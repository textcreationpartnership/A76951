         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This is the wiſdome by which <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought his wonders above nature; and all the Prophets after him to Chriſt, and it is that which our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe taught to his Apoſtles, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and which the Comforter doth continually teach the Holy ſervants of God ever ſince: and by what is written by this Author, it may be beleeved that both the ſame wiſdome may be attained now, and the ſame power of the Holy Ghoſt, by which they ſpake and wrought their Miracles, and the cauſe diſcerned why ſcarce any hath been wrought for ſo long a while: yes, men will beleeve that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things ſhall be done, as our Saviour tells the Apoſtles, then they ſaw him doe: for it will appeare, that the power in one Man, even of one thought in a Man, is able to change the whole univerſe in a moment: this Power was in part in the Prophets and Apoſtles, who could raiſe the dead; and when the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed is come, that all the dead ſhall riſe, that Power will doe it, though it ſhould be but as a graine of muſtard-ſeed in One Man, and reſtore the whole Creature to the glorious Libertie of the ſonnes of God: ſurely it will be worth our paines, to find ſuch wiſdome as this.</p>
                  <p>By the ſtudy of theſe writings, men may come to know, (every one according to his condition, propertie, and inclination) how all the reall d fferences of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, of all ſorts, may be reconciled; even the niceſt differences of the moſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171923:6"/> learned Criticks in all Ages: that which ſeemeth different in the writings of the profound <hi>Magicall,</hi> Myſticall <hi>Chimick Philoſophers,</hi> from that which wee find in the experimentall <hi>Phyſicians, Philoſophers, Aſtronomers, Aſtrologers,</hi> and <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> may be reconeiled by conſidering what this Author teacheth, that the Names which were given to the ſeven Planets, doe ſignifie the ſeven Properties of the Eternall Nature, and are the cauſe of all thoſe things, which are by experimentall men accounted the firſt and deepeſt cauſes of all.</p>
                  <p>Alſo thereby the differences in Religion, may be ſo reconciled, that the minds, and Conſciences of all doubting perſons may bee ſatisfied about Predeſtination, Election, Creation, corruption, Salvation, and Reſtoration, ſo cleerely, that all will love one another, and that hard leſſon to love our Enemies, will bee readily learnt, and men will quietly contribute to the ſtudying that one neceſſarie thing, that treaſure hid in the field, that gold of the Kingdome of Heaven, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pearle, that All in All, Faith and Love, and Chriſt, and God, when they ſhall perceive that all this lyeth hid in everie ſoule, in one meaſure or other, and may be found, and the way ſet downe ſo plaine, that every ſoule may find it.</p>
                  <p>Thereby the writings of all men will be underſtood, even the very darkeſt Myſteries, contained in the writings of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, will be made plaine, and eaſie to the ſimpleſt thirſtie ſoule, and then, when that appeareth which is now hidden, that excellent glorie, every one will not onely ſee it, but walke in the way that leadeth to it, and ſo attaine it in the higheſt Degree of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones capacity, and capability.</p>
                  <p>While this Wiſdome is growing, it will ſo reforme the Lawes, by degrees in every Nation, that at length, the whole world will be governed in Peace to the Joy of All.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſome will thinke this impoſſible, let them conſider, that if they bee told of a curious City, and of the incredible things that are done there, by him that hath been there, and ſeen what he relateth, and he deſcribe the way ſo plaine, that they may come thither themſelvs, will they not goe, that they may know, as well as he that told them: doe ſo by this Author; Reade this Booke diligently, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, till you apprehend the true meaning but of ſome part of the way hee here deſcribeth, which may eaſily be done, and you will be ſatisfied the things are true, and that the way he ſheweth is true, and be able to walke in it, and alſo bee very thirſtie to labour in that way, more and more, till you attaine your whole deſire: and then you will keep it as the beſt Jewell, a Memoriall of all Myſteries.</p>
                  <p>But let every one reade it themſelves, whether it be the higheſt King that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth upon a Throne, or the meaneſt mayd that grindeth in a Mill, or heare it read with their owne eares, if they meane to pertake of this ſo high a gift from the moſt high, or elſe the Devill may eaſily bereave them of it.</p>

Or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoule? the ſoule is ſo precious that nothing can truly be valued at ſo high a Rate. To ſave it is the greateſt gaine, to looſe it is the greateſt loſſe: then who will not highly priſe the ſtudy and underſtanding of the way to ſave it.

Your heavenly Father will give the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit to them that aske it,</hi> and by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and controverſies in Religion, which he knew not how to ſatisfie himſelfe in; he was ſo ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up and moved, to aske, ſeeke, and knock, that he might know the truth; upon which by the <hi>Divine
<pb facs="tcp:171923:8"/> drawing and will,</hi> he was in Spirit wrapt into <hi>the holy Sabbath</hi> in which he remained ſeven whole dayes in higheſt joy by his owne confeſsion; after he came to himſelfe he layd aſide the folly of youth, and was driven by Divine zeale earneſtly to reprehend impudent, ſcandalous, and blaſphemous ſpeeches, and did forbeare in all his actions the leaſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of evill; and continued to get his living by the labour of his hands, till the beginning of the ſixt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum, which was the yeare <hi>160.</hi> When he was a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time poſſeſſed with a divine Light, and by the ſight of a ſudden object, was brought to the inward ground or Center of the hidden nature: yet ſomewhat doubting, he went out into an open field, and there beheld the miraculous workes of the Creatour in the ſignatures, figures, or ſhapes of all created things, very clearely and manifeſtly layde open; whereupon he was taken with exceeding joy, yet held his peace in ſilence prayſing God. But ten yeares after in the yeare <hi>1610.</hi> through the overſhadowing of the holy Spirit, he was a third time touched by God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and became ſo inlightned, that leaſt ſo great grace beſtowed upon him ſhould ſlip out of his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and he reſiſt his God, he wrote privately for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, (without the help of any Bookes but the Holy Scriptures) many Bookes the Titles whereof follow at the end of this worke. Which bookes contaire ſuch high and deep grounded Myſteries of the Deity, as have not been reveal'd ſince the Apoſtles times.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>18. Novemb. Stilo novo,</hi> betimes in the morning he cal'd one of his ſons, and asked if he alſo
<pb facs="tcp:171923:8"/> heard that excellent muſick? he ſaid no, then he bad that the dore ſhould be opened, that that muſick might be the better heard. Afterwards be asked what a clock it was? being anſwer'd that it had ſtruck two; he ſaid, it is not yet my time, my time is three houres hence, in the meane time he was heard to ſpeake theſe words.
<q>O thou ſtrong God of hoſts deliver me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy will, O thou crucified Lord Jeſus, have mercy upon me, and receive me into thy Kingdome.</q>
                  </p>

                  <p>If it were not for the great fruit that I conceive may grow to every one that ſtudieth it, I ſhould be ſorry that I am the Inſtrument, to make ſuch things knowne in my Native Language; and much more unwilling it ſhould be publiſhed to the view of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny various minds, as are now ſprung up: But my hope is, goodneſſe will get the upper hand, and that the fruits of the Spirit will prevaile to the ſubduing of the Luſts of the fleſh: now I readily ſubmit to the cenſure of thoſe who have that good deſire: and of thoſe who are not proudly and perverſly wedded to their owne conceits, (when they have conſidered this Authors meaning:) whether this will not be as bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to us as it hath been to other Nations: Indeed my mind is lead to think, that our troubled doubting Soules may receive much comfort leading to that
<pb facs="tcp:171923:9"/> inward Peace which paſſeth all underſtanding: that all the diſturbing Sects and Hereſies ariſing from the Darkneſſe and malice of men and Devills, will be made to vaniſh, and ceaſe by that underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which may be kindled in them from it: they that rule will perceive how to effect all their good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, to the joy and happineſſe of them that are ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to their government; and Subjects will ſoone learne to obey in every thing as the Primitive Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs did, though they ſhould live under ſuch Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours as they did: ſo God ſhall be glorified by all mens love to one another, and peace will flouriſh over all the Earth.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſome will think it ſo hard to attaine the underſtanding of this Author, when they read the anſwer to the firſt Queſtion, (which is far more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult then any of the other, becauſe it containes the ſumme of them all in brief) that they will forbeare to take ſo much paines as they ſuppoſe is requiſite; but if it ſhould prove a little harder then other writings, the profit will countervaile the Labour with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredfold advantage; yet let every one read it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or heare it read with their owne eares, that others miſreport hinder them not from ſo great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and they ſhall no doubt attaine it, for I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by my owne experience that every one may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive according to their vaſt or narrow capacity, who have according to mine owne meaſure been ſatisfied, though I be</p>

The God of Heaven onely can reveale ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret things: it is not in my Reaſon to anſwer the King, but yet, that the King may perceive the thoughts of his heart God hath revealed it, not that my Reaſon is greater then any mans living.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> So likewiſe I ſay to you: you ſhall be anſwered (not that my reaſon is greater then any mans living; but onely that you may perceive the thoughts, the earneſt ſeeking and deſire of your heart,) it is given me to anſwer you.</p>

And although men cannot ſay of God that the pure Deity is Nature, but that it is the Majeſty in the Ternary: yet we muſt ſay that God is in Nature, although Nature can as little reach or comprehend him as the Aire can comprehend the Sunſhine: However we muſt ſay; that Nature is borne in his will, and that it is a SEEKING, produced out of Eternity; for where there is no Will, there is alſo no Deſire.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. Then if we diſcerne and know that there is not onely Light and Majeſty, but alſo Darkeneſſe, as is plaine; it behoves us to know whence Darkeneſſe ariſeth.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For in the Eternity beyond Nature there can be no Darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for there is nothing to bring it forth: we muſt onely looke into the Will and the Deſiring, for a deſiring is attracting.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And whereas in the Eternity it hath nothing but onely it ſelfe, it draweth it ſelfe into the Will, and maketh the Will full, and that is its darkeneſſe, whereas otherwiſe, if it were not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it were a Nothing,<note n="k" place="margin">Or <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </note> but an eternall ſtillneſſe withour<note n="l" place="margin">Or <hi>Being.</hi>
                     </note> Eſſence.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Thus the Attraction maketh<note n="m" place="margin">Moveable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> Mobility and Eſſences which otherwiſe could not be in the ſtillneſſe: and ſo alſo this maketh<note n="n" place="margin">Aſtringency <hi>or</hi> bitingneſſe.</note> harſhneſſe, hardneſſe, and drouth together with<note n="o" place="margin">Acidneſſe.</note> ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Neither can we ſay for all that, that the Darkeneſſe ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth up the Light, as the Eternall Liberty; for, that which is Eternall cannot be altered nor changed: but yet we muſt ſay that Light and Darkneſſe are in one another.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Now the Light is good and hath<note n="p" place="margin">Or <hi>power.</hi>
                     </note> vertue, but the Darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath the harſhneſſe, hardneſſe and coldneſſe: and the deſire of the Will maketh Eſſences and attracting, which is a<note n="q" place="margin">Riggling.</note> ſtirring in the hardneſſe, and if that which is attracted doe ſtirre by the drawing then it cauſeth a jarring, whereby Light and Darkeneſſe are mingled together in the ſharpneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And we muſt conſider, how the free Light is ſharpened in the Eſſence in the ſharpe ſtirring, whereby we come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the<note n="r" place="margin">Lightening.</note> fire-flaſh, and the eagerneſſe; and yet we cannot ſay that there is any rending.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. For that which is Eternall without beginning admits no ſevering, but ſtands as a wheele which begetteth it ſelfe in it ſelfe: whereof you have a ſimilitude in the Mind of Man, where indeede there is a Will of a riſing and runing, but no removing: the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Will is, the greater alſo is the<note n="ſ" place="margin">Or <hi>Beeing.</hi>
                     </note> Eſſence, and the more ſtrongly it is ſharpned.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Thus the ſtill Liberty which is neither Darkeneſſe nor Light is ſharpned in the ſharpe Deſiring attracting, ſo that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth as a flaſh which ſhineth.</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:171923:11"/>16. Alſo we cannot ſay that the Liberty doth take in the flaſh, for from Eternity it hath had Nothing: but we can well ſay, that the Light and Splendor ſhineth in the Liberty.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. For that which is free letteth in the Light, but that which is not free (as the<note n="t" place="margin">Or <hi>eſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</hi>
                     </note> harſhneſſe which maketh Darkeneſſe, and is materiall, to ſpeake in a Spirituall ſenſe) that doth not receive the Light.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. This we can truely ſay, that whatſoever is tranſparent and not of a<note n="u" place="margin">Mild <hi>or</hi> fluid.</note> groſſe Nature doth take in the Light, as appeareth by the water which taketh in the Light, and the harſh Earth not.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Moreover in Fire you have a ſufficient manifeſtation of the Eſſence of all Eſſences, for you ſee that the Fire burneth in an harſh drie matter, for it is the harſh Deſire which entreth into it ſelfe like a great anguiſh, and reacheth after the Liberty; where alſo it receiveth the Liberty, like a flaſh, and it kindleth by the flaſh that it burneth.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And although it muſt be underſtood that there is no ſuch fire in the Eternall Eſſence as that is which appeareth externally, yet it is internally, in the harſh Deſire and externally remaineth darke: Therefore the Eternall Fire is externally darke, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, as it is in it ſelfe in the Will of the Eternall Liberty it is a Light, which ſhineth in the Still Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="21">21.<note n="*" place="margin">Or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences kinds or manners.</note> Now then, we underſtand, that in Fire there are ten Formes; all which are borne in the Will, and all belong proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Eternall Will: therefore we rightly ſay that the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Will is Gods Will: and that the Liberty which hath the Will is God himſelfe, for it is the Eternity and nothing elſe.</p>

                     <p n="22">22. Firſt, there is the Eternall Liberty, which hath the Will, and is it ſelfe the Will: now every Will hath a<note n="x" place="margin">Or <hi>longing.</hi>
                        </note> ſeeking to doe or to deſire ſomething; and herein it beholdeth it ſelfe, and ſeeth in the Eternity what it ſelfe is; it maketh to it ſelfe a glaſſe of its owne likeneſſe, for it ſeeth what it ſelfe is, and ſo finding nothing but it ſelfe it deſireth it ſelfe.</p>

                     <head>The ſecond Forme.</head>
                     <p n="23">23. The ſecond Forme is the Deſiring, and yet it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but it ſelfe, thereupon its deſire ſeeketh a modell of its owne Will in it ſelfe, and maketh it ſelfe pregnant, ſo that a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or over-ſhadowing commeth to be in the Will: which the Will would not have; but the Deſire: the ſeeking cauſeth it; and yet there is Nothing that is able to conſume or expell the Deſire.</p>

                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:171923:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>24. For that which is before the Deſire, beyond the ſeeking is Free and a Nothing, and yet it is: yet if it were a thing that could be perceived, it were an Eſſence, and muſt ſubſiſt in that Eſſence which brought it forth: but ſeeing it is without Eſſence, it is the Eternity, <hi>viz.</hi> Good: For it is no ſource, and hath alſo no Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but it is a Reſt and an Eternall Peace.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. But ſeeing the immenſe Space is bottomleſſe, therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither number nor end and alſo no beginning, therefore it is like a Glaſſe, it is All things and get as a Nothing: it behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe, and yet findeth nothing but an A, which is its<note n="a" place="margin">Originali Textu.

                     <p n="26">26. A V is the Eternall Originall of ſomething, for it is the Eternall beginning and the Eternal End: Thus the Eternal Abyſſe looketh into it ſelfe and findeth it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. The A is below and the V is above, and the O is the Eye, and although it be no Eſſence it ſelfe, yet thus it is the Originall of Eſſence; there is neither below nor above but its Glaſſe in the A V is a ſight.<note place="margin">As the ſight of the Eye.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p n="31">31. For it is a Globe like an Eye, &amp; it is<note n="e" place="margin">Gods won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Eye.</note> the Eye of Gods Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, wherein every thing was ſeene from Eternity, yet without Eſſence, as in a Glaſſe or Eye, for it is the Eye of the Abyſſe; concerning which we have no Pen, Tongue nor utterance either to write or ſpeake; onely the Spirit of Eternity leadeth the Eye
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:171923:12"/> of the Soule thereinto; and ſo we ſee it, elſe it muſt remaine in Silence; and this hand could not deſcribe any thing of it.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. Now ſeeing that in the Eternity there is ſuch an Eye, which is God himſelfe, (and yet is not called God but Eternity; and according to the Eye he is called A and ☉, before the A there is Nothing, and in the ☉ there is All, and in the A and ☉ beginning and End) hence we finde, that there is a Will in the ☉, and the Will is the ☉ it ſelfe which maketh the A, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Eternall beginning of the<note n="e" place="margin">Drawing <hi>or</hi> longing, <hi>or</hi> attracting.</note> ſeeking) ſo that the Abyſſe beholdeth it ſelfe, and maketh a Forme in it ſelfe like a Globe.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. For the Eye finding no bottome, it cloſeth it ſelfe, and becommeth like a round Globe of Glaſſe, and ſo it is the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Eternity, in that it can finde it ſelfe: for there is no finding in the Abyſſe, becauſe there is no place or limit but the meere Abyſſe: and when it doth find it ſelfe in the Eye, yet it findeth nothing but the Eye, which is the Globe.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. Now the Eye maketh the Globe, and it is the Globe, and all put together is a<note n="f" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Will.</note> Will to ſeeke it ſelf, and ſo to ſee what the Eternity is, which is made manifeſt in the Eye.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. For the Eye maketh a beginning and an End; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing that can give it, it giveth it ſelfe, and it is from Eternity to Eternity, the Eternity it ſelfe, it <hi rend="sup">g</hi> toucheth Nothing for it is a Nothing in it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. Then if there be a Will, which is the Eye, and which keepeth the Eye, that keeping is the Deſire of the Eye, and ſo the Deſire cauſeth an attraction in the Eye, yet nothing is there but the Eye: and the Deſire onely attracteth it ſelfe in the Eye, and impregnateth the Eye with that which is attracted, ſo that it becommeth full, and yet alſo nothing is there but a darkening of the Free Eye; yet the Eye is not darke, but the Deſire in the Eye is impregnated in it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. For the Will of the Eye is ſtill: and the Deſire of the Will maketh it ſelfe full, and the Eye continueth free in it ſelfe: For it is free in and from Eternity, and this we call the Eternall Liberty in all our Writings.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="3" type="form">
                     <head>The third Forme.</head>
                     <p n="38">38. Now a Deſire is ſharpe and attractive, and that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:171923:13"/> maketh the third Forme, <hi>viz.</hi> a moving in it ſelfe, and it is the Originall of the Eſſences; and hence come the Eſſences in the Eye and in the Will, and yet the Wil I may not ſuffer it ſelfe to be attracted.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. For its peculiar right is to be ſtill, and to hold the Eye in the Circle in the Globe, and yet it cannot defend it ſelfe from the drawing and filling, for it hath nothing wherewith it can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it ſelfe, but the deſire.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. And here ariſeth the Eternall Enmity and contrary will, the Will, will not be darke, and its Deſire maketh it darke, the Will would ſuffer the Motion willingly, becauſe it is its manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, but the drawing in and darkning pleaſeth it not, though indeed the Will is not attracted nor darkned, but the Deſire in the Will impregnateth it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. Now when the Deſire thus ſticketh faſt in the darkeneſſe, there is a great anguiſh, for it is troubled and attracted and alſo darkned, and bringeth anxiety to it ſelfe in it ſelfe, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth liberty: and drawing ſo ſtrongly at the liberty, would faine draw it ſelfe into the Liberty, and ſo it maketh it ſelf more eager, rough and hard, and the Darkneſſe is like an horrible conſuming ſharpeneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="42">42. For it ſnatcheth the Liberty into it ſelfe: but it is ſo ſharpe that it appeareth in the Liberty as a flaſh of lightning, which conſumeth the darkneſſe with its eagerneſſe: and hence it is that God ſaith, <hi>I am a</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 44. But that you may ſearch yet deeper, know, that the Fire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Originally conſiſteth in three Formes, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Deſire, and then in the matter of that which is attracted, <hi>viz.</hi> in the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in which Eſſentiality proceedeth from the Attraction, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> thirdly, the Anguiſh ſource, and it ſelfe maketh the fourth Forme, that is the flaſh, for the Liberty cauſeth that, and is the kindler of the anguiſh ſource.</p>
                     <p n="45">45. For the Deſire in the Darkneſſe, would have nothing elſe but the Liberty, and the Liberty is a light without ſhining, it is like a very deepe blew colour mixed with greene, ſo that it is not knowne what colour it is, for all colours are in it; and the Deſire in it ſelfe in its eager anguiſh and ſharpneſſe breaketh the colours, and maketh an horrible conſuming flaſh in it ſelfe, and

                     <p n="47">47. For the Eye is made manifeſt in the Light, and the<note n="a" place="margin">Or Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</note> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiality is made mannifeſt in the Will, and then it is knowne what Light or Darkneſſe is: alſo thus the Eternity is knowne, and ſo Gods Holineſſe alwayes ariſeth in the wonders from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and it hath neither limit nor beginning, for it is an Eternall beginning comprehended in Nothing but only in the Wonders, which are its owne Eſſence, where there is neither limit nor<note n="b" place="margin">Time or yeares.</note> number.</p>
                     <p n="48">48. And thus nothing is knowne in the ſtill Eternity, but the glance of the Majeſty, and the Spirit which is borne in the Will, and the Majeſty hath the<note n="c" place="margin">Regiment.</note> Dominion.</p>
                     <p n="49">49. Beloved friend, underſtand the ſenſe right: we meane not, that the Birth apprehendeth the Liberty without, but within it ſelfe in its Centre, it apprehendeth it ſelfe in it ſelfe, and maketh Majeſty in it ſelfe, and yet there is no including there, but it is, as when life ariſeth from Death or from Nothing, which<note n="d" place="margin">Life.</note> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth onely in it ſelfe, and this is called a<note n="e" place="margin">Principium.</note> Principle: and that wherein it dwelleth is called Nature, which hath ſeven Spirits and Formes, as is to be ſeene in our ſecond and third Booke.</p>
                     <p n="50">50. Yet this Principle hath but one Spirit, which is the life of that Principle, and it hath but one will neither, which is the<note n="f" place="margin">Or ſatiating.</note> fulfilling of the Eternity with the glance of the Majeſty.</p>
                     <p n="51">51. For this principle is the Power proceeding from the will of Eternity, and the entrance, or the Eternall beginning of the Power, is the Life and the Spirit of the power, which thruſteth forth the Eſſences of the begettreſſe, and openeth the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the Majeſty.</p>
                     <p n="52">52. And the whole Eye (which hath thus<note n="g" place="margin">Or formed, or figured.</note> made it ſelfe a Glaſſe in the A and O) is all things, it is the Eternity, and in it ſelfe in the Eye it begetteth the Majeſty, which is the Heart and power of the Eye, and alſo the Spirit, which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the Power in the Heart, even from the fiery Light fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Eſſences.</p>
                     <p n="53">53. Thus underſtand the Holy Ternary in one Eſſence; the Father is the Eternity without Ground, which is Nothing and yet all things, and in the Eye of his glance he ſeeth that he is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:171923:14"/> all things: and in the Power of the Majeſtie he feeleth, taſteth and ſmelleth that he is Good, that is, that he is God: although the<note n="h" place="margin">The Tau or Croſſe.</note> T. (<hi>viz:</hi> the<note n="i" place="margin">Schwerigkeit oft Breetheit guere.</note> harſhneſſe) ariſeth in the Centre.</p>
                     <p n="54">54. And in the Spirit is the moving of the Power, and the Multiplication without ground and number, wherein conſiſteth an Eternall bottomleſſe multitude, and all in Power.</p>
                     <p n="55">55. For, that which hath no ground hath no number, nor is there any ſhutting up or comprehenſion therein, and that which is within it ſelfe cannot be knowne<note n="k" place="margin">Or without <hi>ab extra.</hi>
                        </note> externally, but it may be felt by the Spirit; Thus the Internall driveth out from it ſelf and manifeſteth it ſelfe in Figures, or elſe God could not be known.</p>
                     <p n="56">56. Thus God is together one Spirit: and is from Eternity in three beginnings and ends, and that onely in himſelfe: There is no place found in his ſight: and he hath nothing in himſelfe that may be compared to him; alſo there is nothing which can ſearch and manifeſt any thing further then his Spirit: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes manifeſteth it ſelfe from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="57">57. He is an Eternall ſeeker and finder of himſelfe in the great Wonders; and that which he findeth he findeth in the Power: He is the Opener of the Power; Nothing is like him, neither doth any thing find him, but that which yieldeth it ſelfe to be his owne, that entreth into him: That which denyeth it ſelfe to be, in that thing the Spirit of God is all things; For it is one onely Will in the Eternall Nothing, and yet it is in all things as Gods Spirit it ſelfe is.</p>
                     <p n="58">58. And this, my beloved friend, is the Higheſt Myſterie: Therefore if you would finde it ſeeke it not in me but in your ſelfe, though not in your Reaſon neither, which muſt be as dead, and your Deſire and will muſt be in God: and ſo God becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the will and the deed in you: alſo the Spirit of God bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your will into himſelfe, and then you may well ſee what God is, and what Spirits child this hand is, and from what kinde of Spirit it writeth.</p>
                     <p n="59">59. Furthermore I brotherly exhort you, that you ſeeke not with ſuch eagerneſſe, you will not reach the bottome of it with ſuch ſearching: although you are knowne and beloved of God; and therefore we give you this for a Rule, yet externally I have no power to give it you.</p>
                     <p n="60">60. But follow my counſell, leave off your laborious ſearching in Reaſon, and enter into the will of God, into Gods Spirit, and caſt outward Reaſon away, and then your will is Gods will, and Gods Spirit will ſeek you within you.</p>
                     <p n="61">61. And if he find your will in him, then he manifeſteth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:171923:14"/> himſelfe in your will, as in his owne propriety. For if you quit that will, then it is His who is all things: and when he moveth goe you with him, for you have Divine Power, and then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you ſearch he is in it, and then nothing is hid from the will: thus you ſee in his Light, and are his.</p>
                     <p n="62">62. And let no feare terrifie you, there is nothing can take it away but your own imagination, let not that enter into your will, and ſo you ſhall worke the wonders of God in his Spirit, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge me your brother in him, elſe I ſhall be but as one that is dumb to you: This I tell you for good will.</p>
                     <p n="63">63. And ſeeing wee write of the Eternity, to the end to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your will, concerning the ſoule, (our purpoſe herein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the will of God) wee will therefore firſt ſhew you the ground of the ſoule, and then its Originall: and ſo open your eyes that you may be freed from your laborious ſearching.</p>
                     <p n="64">64. For you have now to your old-age gone about this, and ſo farre as I underſtand, you have not yet found that deep My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in the Spirit: But ſeeing it is Gods will that you ſhould know it, and have it given you for a reward of your ſo great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, therefore have a care that you receive it aright: and then that you caſt not the Pearle before ſwine, which are not worthy of it, nor will not be worthy of it to Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="65">65. For that which ſhall be revealed to you here, belongeth to the Children of God, therefore be faithfull and employ it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit, and not according to humane reaſon.</p>
                     <p n="66">66. For it is ſo ſublime that it will not endure earthlineſſe which proceeds from Covetouſneſſe, Pride, Selfe-glory and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy, although you be not ſuch; but looke well into whom you poure oyle, for it is poyſon to many: let others themſelves ſeeke as you have done; But give the Children bread that they may eate, and praiſe Our Father which is in Heaven, for to that end it is given you.</p>

As wee have opened an entrance and a glaſſe to you of the Eternall Originall, from whence the Eternall fire proceeds, and what it is, ſo it is alſo neceſſary, that wee ſhew you further according to the higheſt depth, what the Eternall Nature is, in its propagation.</p>
                     <p n="68">68. Wherein wee muſt underſtand two Kingdomes, the one good and pleaſant, the other an evill, wrathfull, and ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſad one: of which the Philoſophers from the beginning of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:171923:15"/> the world have treated, and ſought after it, but the time of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it was not then.</p>
                     <p n="69">69. But now it is at hand, that the hidden<note n="l" place="margin">Or ſecret Myſterie.</note> thing ſhould be found, not onely by me, but alſo by many that will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and humble themſelves to God, and ſeeke in his Spirit and will; it will be found in the Eye of God onely, and no where elſe; therefore let none dive deeper in ſearching elſewhere, or he will find the Devill.</p>
                     <p n="70">70. Seeing then the Eternity is thus which yet is Nothing, and yet there is Light and Darkneſſe, Life and Spirit, which are all things: and ſo there is a ſeeking (that is, a deſire) in both, to find it ſelfe, though there be Nothing that can be<note n="m" place="margin">Or that can find any thing.</note> found but the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="71">71. Now ſeeing it hath nothing that it can find, and yet the Deſire goeth on Eternally forward, therefore the Deſire is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the ſeeking will, the ſimilitude of the Eye of God, and it is as a glaſſe of the Eternall Eye which is called God.</p>
                     <p n="72">72. Now this is in two manner of wayes, one according to the Light, and the other according to the Darkneſſe: for the ſeeking is in both; and yet there is no departing of the one from the other; the Light is in the Internall, and the Darkneſſe in the Externall, and yet that which is moſt internall is alſo moſt Externall, but the Light is the middlemoſt.</p>
                     <p n="73">73. For it is in the Nothing; therefore it cannot be the moſt internall, for it hath no Place nor limit; it is its owne finding, which the Darkneſſe findeth not, but the will in the Darkneſſe, which deſireth the Light, goeth out from the darkneſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth Eternally in the Light.</p>
                     <p n="74">74. Now the Deſire of the Light preſenteth a Modell like it ſelfe, wherein the Eternity is manifeſt: that is, all whatſoever the Spirit, in the Eternall power of God, findeth in it ſelfe from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="75">75. This Modell is not God the Eternity it ſelfe; for it taketh its beginning in the Spirit, and it is the wonder of the Spirit which it ſeeketh and findeth from Eternity; and<note n="n" place="margin">The Modell.</note> it is in the Eye of God as a figure, and all the wonders of the Abyſſe of Eternity are therein, and are beheld in the Light of the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, as one wonder in many Endleſſe wonders.</p>
                     <p n="76">76. Alſo it is an Image of God, a Virgin full of purity and chaſtity, and no begettreſſe, for the Holy Spirit onely openeth the Wonders in the Power.</p>

This now alſo hath two differences, for the Light-life hath its owne ſource and driving, and the Fire-life alſo its ſource and driving, each in it ſelfe: but the Fire-life is the cauſe of the Light-life, and the Light-life is Lord of the Fire-life, and herein lyeth the<note n="i" place="margin">Myſterium Magnum.</note> Great Myſterie.</p>

For if there were no Fire there would be no Light, and alſo no Spirit, and if there were no Spirit to blow up the Fire it would be ſmothered, and Darkneſſe would be, and the one would be a Nothing without the other, therefore they belong both together, and yet divide themſelves one from another, but without any<note n="k" place="margin">Or <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>

                     <p n="102">102. You may underſtand it by this: looke upon the glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire; firſt there is the Matter from whence it burneth, <hi>viz.</hi> the harſh attracted bitter ſubſtance, which hath an Anguiſh ſource, and is a<note n="l" place="margin">Corpus Opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> darke Body, whether it be wood or any ſuch thing.</p>
                     <p n="103">103.

                     <p n="104">104.

                     <p n="110">110. Now when this hath conſumed it, then the Anguiſh is a Darkneſſe againe, and the flaſh remaineth hidden in it ſelfe againe; and is an Extinguiſhing, and the anguiſh is in the darkneſſe as at firſt, before the flaſhing of the Fire, and it remaineth onely in a terrible ſource, where the bitterneſſe is alwayes made more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by the rough attraction.</p>

But the will in the anguiſh (becauſe it can attaine or finde nothing) therefore it maketh a figure and a ſimilitude to it ſelfe in the deſiring with the eager attraction, and the eager, harſh, bitter darke Eſſence, is the Materiall ſimilitude it ſelfe, it eateth it ſelfe, and is it ſelfe the matter of the Fire, that ſo the Eternall flaſh may alwayes continue, and the wrath is alwayes an Eternally continuing burning, and burneth Eternally, out of the Darkneſſe, and hath its owne Life in it ſelfe, <hi>viz.</hi> the bitter ſting of the Anguiſh, which rageth and raveth, and is the<note n="r" place="margin">Rigling.</note> ſtirring and originall of the Life, and that is<note n="ſ" place="margin">Or <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium.</hi>

Thus the Fire-will is a<note n="t" place="margin">Sucking <hi>or</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</note> ſeeking of the high ſwelling Pride, and a Contempt of the darkneſſe: it contemneth its owne roote; it is covetous and would devoure more then it hath, or more then it ſhould, it hath all luſts; for the deſiring Eſſences are manifeſt in

Seeing then Man by his Imagination hath deſtroyed the heavenly Angelicall Body, and hath brought it into a corruptible number, that is, into the outward Principle, and therefore he is in it: for he hath loſt the Paradificall number, and is placed in the hundreth number, wherein he is alſo now given up to the Outward Life, as to his leader, that is, he hath given himſelfe up to this Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo that his number, to be fulfilled in the Circle of the Outward Principle, is cleerely knowne to us.</p>
                     <p n="124">124. If we knew certainly the houre of the ſixt Day wherein the Creation was finiſhed, we could then ſet you downe the yeare and day (we meane the<note n="i" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Day.</note> laſt Day) for it goeth not a minute further, it hath its limit hidden in the inward Circle.</p>
                     <p n="125">125. Therefore know for certaine that the time is neare; for in the ſixt Day afternoone the Reſt of the Eternall Day began, and therefore God inſtituted the Sabbath of the ſeventh Day, for a Reſt, and an everlaſting Remembrance.</p>
                     <p n="126">126. And as the Reſt began on the ſixt Day towards the Evening, and the Entrance to the manifeſtation of the<note n="k" place="margin">Working,<hi>Viz.</hi> the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> workes of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (the End then taking in the beginning againe, and the ſix Dayes ſtood thus in the Circle as a wonder) ſo know that ye were created in Paradiſe, and yet are gone out from it into the Spirit of Wrathfulneſſe into Death<note n="l" place="margin">Which Spirit</note>; which hath now wrought its wonders in you theſe 5500. yeares and upwards.</p>
                     <p n="127">127. And now the End hath found the beginning againe, and ye ſhall ſee, alſo feele and finde, what Paradiſe hath been, even eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them that ſhall be borne in God.</p>
                     <p n="128">128. For (to ſpeake after the manner of Reaſon, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God) Paradiſe is borne againe, but ye ſhall not eſcape mortality, nor the wrath in the Fleſh, but Paradiſe is now already manifeſt in the Minde, in the ſoule of the Children of God, and they have the true taſte of the Power.</p>
                     <p n="129">129. And no ſubtilty nor power can hinder it, no ſubtilty can ſuppreſſe it, nor can any Devill deſtroy it; for the End hath found the beginning, there can be no hinderance of it, the Power of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood breaketh, and then remaineth nothing but a waiting for the bridegroome, for the Children of God ſhall be found in Paradiſe,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:171923:19"/> when the <hi>Turba</hi> in the Wrath ſhall be ſwallowed up. We ſpeake high things, yet we underſtand and know them certainly in the Wonders.</p>
                     <p n="130">130. Thus as is mentioned above (if you underſtand us aright) there is borne out of the Wrathfulneſſe of the Anger; out of the Eternall Centre (out of which this world was produced and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is a<note n="m" place="margin">Or <hi>attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                        </note> ſeeking of the Eternall:) in the Spirit of this world, (in this Principle wherein we now live:) and there will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be borne falſhood, Covetouſneſſe, ſubtilty, deceit, enmity, in the Will; Lying, Murder, Pride, deſire of honour, Selfe-Power, Art,<note n="n" place="margin">Cunning <hi>or</hi> Policy.</note> wit, the wiſdome of this world proceeding from Reaſon, they all come from this roote and remaine in the Wonders of Gods Anger, and though Reaſon and ſelfe<note n="o" place="margin">Or <hi>Wit.</hi>
                        </note> prudence be never ſo fine, yet it is in the Anger of God, and ſpringeth from the Abyſſe.</p>
                     <p n="131">131. And here behold thy ſelfe thou faire world; it is no Fable, as thou holdeſt it to be, it is knowne in <hi>Ternario Sancto,</hi> and he that cannot get within the limit of that, he is captivated by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and belongeth at laſt to that Lake from whence he ſprung, it is no time to linger now, both the doores ſtand open; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath growne in the <hi>Turba</hi> ſhall be ſwallowed up with it.</p>
                     <p n="132">132. So alſo conſider the Eternall Fire further, and take a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude from all ſorts of fire in this world, for that which is a Spirit, in the Eternity, is a ſubſtance in this world. You ſee alſo that fire in it ſelfe is an anguiſhing wrathfull riſing bitter Eſſence and ſource, and yet you ſee nothing elſe in the proper Forme of Fire, but the flaſh which ſhineth, you ſee not the ſource, you can onely feele that.</p>
                     <p n="133">133. You ſee alſo that the fire when it burneth, ſendeth up from it ſelfe a Smoake, in which there is water, whence ſoote cometh which ſticketh to the ſides, eſpecially where the fire is incloſed and not free, then the ſoote is ſeene as in a chimney; and the ſoot and water are in one another, and thus the Materiall Earth cometh originally from the Eternall fire; which Lucifer kindled; Then in the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe Time began, and the Creation was after that manner which is mentioned in the Third Booke.</p>
                     <p n="134">134. Underſtand, the<note n="p" place="margin">Myſterium Magnum.</note> Great Myſterie further: you ſee that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fire giveth light, and you ſee alſo that Aire goeth forth from the ſource of the Fire, and you know very well that if the fire had no Aire to blow it up, it would be ſmothered, as all fires are ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered when they have no Aire, and yet they produce Aire.</p>
                     <p n="135">135. The Aire is the life of the fire, and the Aire hath its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from the Anguiſhing bitter ſtirring ſource of the Eſſences, out of the Will: Now you ſee alſo very well, that fire muſt have few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell to burne, or elſe it is a Darkneſſe, and although it devoure it ſelfe (by its eager attraction,) yet that fire is nothing but a ſource
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:171923:19"/> in the Darkneſſe, which we underſtand to be the Abyſſe of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, which is not manifeſt in God, but is onely as a cauſe of the Life in the Kingdome of God.</p>
                     <p n="136">136. You ſee that all fire muſt have<note n="q" place="margin">Subſtance.</note> matter, or elſe it will not burne, underſtand it thus, the fire produceth Aire, and in the Aire water, and it mightily attracteth the Aire with the water into it ſelfe againe, whereby the ſource of the fire is ſo allayed that it ſhineth.</p>
                     <p n="137">137. For without water no fire ſhineth, if no water can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in a thing, in that thing the fire will not ſhine, but glimmer; as for example, in<note n="r" place="margin">Glowing.</note> a red hot ſtone, which hath the ſource of the fire, and no ſhining but a glimmering, and hardly that, but in Iron it ſhineth wherein the fire hath water: and therefore Iron at length cometh to be conſumed and getteth Ruſt, but a ſtone doth not: This is thus according to the Outward Principle of this World; but according to the inward (<hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdome of God) it is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lometh, obſerve it.</p>
                     <p n="138">138. The Eternall fire burneth Eternally; yet it is a Spirit: but not manifeſted according to the wrathfulneſſe in the Kingdome of God: underſtand it thus: the flaſh maketh a ſhining; which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the fire, and yet it dwelleth not in the wrath of the Fire, but ſatia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eth the fire wholly, and giveth light alſo out from the fire, and is not comprehended nor retained by the fire: but carrieth with it another ſource of its owne, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <note n="ſ" place="margin">Amiableneſſe <hi>or</hi> Friendli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> Meekneſſe, and yet hath the Power<note n="t" place="margin">Wit, reaſon, <hi>or</hi> knowledge.</note> Wiſdome and Art of the Fire, for in the Light, the Eſſences of the Source of the fire are firſt manifeſted.</p>
                     <p n="139">139. Now the light maketh no<note n="u" place="margin">Or <hi>paine.</hi>
                        </note> ſource, but it entreth into it ſelfe into a Meekneſſe, and yet is deſiring, which proceedeth from the ſource of the Fire; and its deſiring is an attraction of the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and power into it ſelfe: and ſo it maketh it ſelfe pregnant with Meekneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="140">140. For the Light is a Fire alſo, a very yerning fire, a deſiring fire, and a perpetuall finding Fire, which alwayes findeth what is generated in the Originall.</p>
                     <p n="141">141. All the Power which ariſeth in the wrathfull fire, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the Light; and the Light deſireth it in meekneſſe: for the wrathfulneſſe of the Fire and the ſhining of the Light, are two Principles, of a twofold ſource, each dwelling in it ſelfe, and one comprehendeth not the other, to Eternity, and yet the one is the life and the cauſe of the other.</p>
                     <p n="142">142. And we muſt underſtand it thus: we muſt conſider that an horrible anguiſhing<note n="*" place="margin">Or <hi>paine.</hi>
                        </note> ſource maketh a ſinking into it ſelfe, like Death, wherein the limit of Separation is, and yet the Anguiſh keepeth its ſource in it ſelfe: but the ſinking into it ſelfe as it were into Death entreth into its<note n="x" place="margin">Skie, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle.</note> Aether, wherein the life of the Anguiſh is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:171923:20"/> no more knowne: for the ſinkng breaketh forth from the anguiſh ſource, as a dying, and it is a dying, and yet in the Eternity there is no dying; but a kind of entring into another world, of another Principle, of another ſource.</p>
                     <p n="143">143. For the ſinking entreth into the ſtill Eternity; <hi>viz.</hi> into the Liberty; and as the ſource of the wrathfull Fire did remaine in it ſelfe, in its life, ſo the ſinking is a going quite out from the fire-Life, and yet it proceedeth from the fire-life, but it hath not the ſource thereof, for it is broken off from that in Death: and the limit of the Separation is a Death; ſo that the ſinking Life pierceth through Death, and ſprouteth through Death forth in another world, and hath another Subſtantiality, (<hi>viz.</hi> another water) wherein the Light ſhineth: and therein is no wrathfulneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="144">144. For in the Eternity there is no Death to detaine any thing with, but there is a kind of entring into ſeverall Conditions: for that which hath no beginning hath alſo no End nor no<note n="y" place="margin">Foundation <hi>or</hi> bottome.</note> ground: and thus the Light ariſeth from the ſource of the fire.</p>
                     <p n="145">145. For the Light dwelleth in the Fire, and yet not in the Fire; it is another world, and it is another Fire, called Love, Power, Wonder, ſweet, milde, pure, and it is no ſubſtance, alſo it is not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but<note n="z" place="margin">
                           <hi>Extra</hi> without.</note> beyond Nature in another Principle.</p>
                     <p n="146">146. It is nothing but a Light flaming Powerfull Majeſty, and it hath its owne Spirit, which bringeth the ſinking through Death, and which ſinking out of the Anguiſh through Death, maketh the ſprouting forth through the Death.</p>
                     <p n="147">147.<note n="a" place="margin">The Spirit.</note> It is free in it ſelfe both from the fire, and from the Light, and it is not held or captivated by either of them both, (no more then the Fire detaineth the Aire:) It proceedeth from the Light, from the power of the Light; and openeth all whatſoever is either in the ſource of the Fire or in the ſource of the Light.</p>
                     <p n="148">148. Yet it hath no feeling of the Fire în it; but it is a blower up of the fire of Light, a producer of the Eſſences of Love in the deſiring Power; and an Opener of the Eſſences of Love.</p>
                     <p n="149">149. And that we might be underſtood (ſpeaking of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences of Love, as of another Fire, let it be obſerved: behold when the light is ſo brought forth through the wrathfulneſſe, that one fire goeth forth through the other, then the fire of Light deſireth the wrathfulneſſe no more, for it is dead to the wrathfulneſſe, and it is a peculiar Fire in it ſelfe, and it ſendeth forth its life out of it ſelfe, which is a ſprouting: for it is both deſiring and attracting whence Eſſences proceed, and it hath all formes in it, as the fire-life hath, alſo ſuch a riſing.</p>
                     <p n="150">150. And yet the Eſſences are borne out of the<note n="b" place="margin">Or <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                        </note> power of the Light, and when they fully taſte one another, there is a meere De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:171923:20"/> and ſatiety, and yet there is nothing that the Deſire of Love can draw into it ſelfe, but it attracteth it ſelfe into it ſelfe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it ſelfe pregnant with the Power of the Majeſty, ſo that this Will becometh ſatiate, and yet it is nothing but this Power, which is an Image of the Wonders: It is a ſimilitude of the Birth; and it is the power it ſelfe: it is the Eſſence of the Spirit from whence the Spirit hath its food, it goeth forth from the Image and<note n="c" place="margin">Moveth, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</note> floateth as the Aire in this world doth.</p>
                     <p n="151">151. Now the Spirit finding nothing like<note n="d" place="margin">Without it ſelfe.</note> it ſelfe, and ſo not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſelfe but in the Power, therefore it is deſiring; for it dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the Ground of the Power, and yet is not the Power it ſelfe, therefore its deſiring maketh a ſimilitude of it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="152">152. For a deſiring is a ſeeking, and the figure of the ſeeking is in the ſeeking; the figure maketh the Seeking manifeſt: Thus the Spirit alſo dwelleth in its owne Figure, in the Power, and in the Light of the Majeſty; and<note n="e" place="margin">
                           <hi>Viz.</hi> The Deſiring.</note> it is an Image according to the property of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="153">153. The Spirit is not the Image; but the ſeeking and its deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is the Image; for it dwelleth in it ſelfe, in its ſeeking; and in its figure it is another Perſon then the figure of the Power, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Eſſence God is ſaid to be Threefold in Perſons.</p>
                     <p n="154">154. But that we may open your Eyes wide, that you may ſee the whole ground of the Deity (for now it both ſhall and muſt be made manifeſt) you muſt looke upon the Great wonders, which we loſt by going forth from Paradiſe, where now we muſt labour in the ſixe working dayes of this world; Therefore conſider now what and where we are; and you ſhall here finde ſuch a thing as was hidden even to Nature.</p>
                     <p n="155">155. Behold, when you will ſpeake of the Trinity, then looke upon the firſt Number, upon the A, upon the Eternall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which is the Father: and then look upon the O, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sonne, and then looke upon the V, which is the proceeding of the Holy Ghoſt, which in himſelfe goeth with the ſinking through the ſharpe wrathfulneſſe into the ſecond Principle which hath E, and goeth forth through the power, as a light fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming flaſh which hath I.<note place="margin">A.

                     <p n="156">156. Now put thereto the ſwift going of the flaming flaſh that is T the omnipotence of the Eternall<note n="f" place="margin">GoTtes.</note> God, which conſumeth in

                     <p n="157">157. The World is Covetous and Ambitious (eſpecially thoſe that will be counted Maſters of Arts) and ſay they know Gold; and are blind people; why doe you not then ſeeke it? perhaps thou wilt aske, how ſhould ye ſeeke it? Goe with the outward life into Death, there the outward life muſt die, and in the anguiſh yeild it ſelfe up into the Number of the Crowne, <hi>viz.</hi> into the number 1000. and there the End is, and the Death ariſeth to a glorious life with a new faire body, you need afford nothing to it but the ſoule, which will then bring forth much fruit, and then thou haſt an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel which is free from the wrathfulneſſe, for it is wholly pure, ſeeke it and you ſhall finde it.</p>

                        </note> body of Angels, ſo that the Spirit ſubſiſteth in an Image; or elſe he would not be knowne.</p>

                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:171923:31"/>271. Thus he knoweth himſelfe in the Image, and ſeeketh the beſt Magick, and he findeth what he ſeeketh, and eateth it, and thereby giveth his will to the Divine Body, ſo that there is an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Holy Principle.</p>
                     <p n="272">272. For the Wonders ariſe in the will of the corporeall Spirit; which wonders take hold of the Spirit of Eternity, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and thus there is a ſound and ſong proceeding from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall wonders, for the Will of the Corporeall Spirit is therein.</p>
                     <p n="273">273. And in theſe ſeven Formes the Joy of the Deity is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and perfected, for it is a ſatiating of the Eternall deſire, and it is the Eternall foode.</p>
                     <p n="274">274. But ſeeing all Eſſences ariſe from fire: Therefore we will cleerely ſet before you the <hi>Myſterium Magnum,</hi> and ſhew you Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, if any to whom this is told and diſcovered, will be blinde, let him adventure<note n="t" place="margin">To periſh.</note> it with <hi>Babell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="275">275. You know that every life conſiſteth in fire and Water, and the Eſſentiality is its Body, and the Body proceedeth from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Spirit: for it is the food of the Spirit, and the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine is the food of the body, and the higheſt and greateſt<note n="u" place="margin">Or <hi>Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                        </note> Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in himſelfe: for the outward body could not ſuſtaine him, if the true life were not in himſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="276">276. Now then Fire is the firſt cauſe of life, and Light is the ſecond cauſe, and the Spirit the third cauſe: and yet there is but one Eſſence, which cloſeth it ſelfe in one onely Body, and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe, and ſo findeth by ſeeking.</p>
                     <p n="277">277. And every Eſſence<note n="x" place="margin">Is.</note> conſiſteth<note n="y" place="margin">In.</note> of two Eſſences, <hi>viz.</hi> of an inward and an outward, one ſeeketh and findeth the other, the outward is Nature, the inward is Spirit above Nature, and yet there is no ſeparation but in that which is included in a Time; there the Time parteth the limit; ſo that the End findeth the beginning.</p>
                     <p n="278">278. Thus you ſee alſo, how the true Eſſentiality ariſeth from the Light: for it is the ſatiating of the will: the water ariſeth from the meekneſſe of the Light, for the Deſire taketh hold of the meekneſſe and keepeth it: becauſe it hath a good<note n="z" place="margin">Or <hi>taſte.</hi>
                        </note> reliſh: and ſo the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe becommeth Eſſentiall, and it is an Eſſence of the Fire, a ſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of the deſiring Wrath, a quenching of the Wrath, and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porality of the Fire: for when the body<note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> periſheth, <hi>or</hi> dyeth, <hi>or</hi> corrupteth, <hi>or</hi> departeth.</note> is dead, then its Spirit is in the beginning; in that which gave a beginning to it, it is in that Glaſſe.</p>
                     <p n="279">279. Now then as the ſource is twofold, ſo alſo the water is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; <hi>viz.</hi> an outward and an inward, the one belongeth to the Spirit, the other to the outward Life; the outward is as it were a Death, and the inward is the life of the outward, for the outward ſtandeth between Wrath and Paradiſe, in the<note n="b" place="margin">Death that is ſunke downe into the Centre in a thing.</note> inſunken Death, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:171923:32"/> the Inward is Paradiſe it ſelfe: for the Spirit groweth up therein out of the Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="280">280. You may very well ſee that this is true, as followeth. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Summer and Winter, Heat and Cold, and your eyes will ſoone be opened, if you be borne not<note n="c" place="margin">Or <hi>without.</hi>
                        </note> outwardly but within your ſelfe, with a true Magick will to finde God; for it is very<note n="d" place="margin">Viſible.</note> plaine.</p>
                     <p n="281">281. For the Water in the Deep ariſeth from the fire, not from the Wrath but from the Light; for the Light proceedeth from the fire and hath a<note n="e" place="margin">Longing, Sucking, Drawing.</note> ſeeking of its owne, it ſeeketh a Glaſſe, to behold it ſelfe in, and it ſeeketh an Habitation, and draweth it<note n="f" place="margin">Or <hi>in.</hi>
                        </note> by its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire into it ſelfe, and dwelleth therein, and that which is drawne in is water which receiveth the Light: elſe if the light did not dwell in the water, the deep of the world could not comprehend the Light: The water is the ſatiating of the Deſire of the Light.</p>
                     <p n="282">282. And the water againe ſeeketh the Glaſſe, and would have a Houſe to dwell in, and that is fleſh; as you ſee, the water recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the ſhadow of all bodily ſubſtances, ſo that the body may be ſeene in the water, and that is, becauſe the ſeeking of the Water hath captivated it.</p>
                     <p n="283">283. Furthermore you ſee herein, the End of Nature; For the Eye findeth its Life in the Water: and ſo goeth back into the ſeventh Forme, and ſeeth its body in the Water the Outward deſireth no more, this body deſireth no other body more in the outward, but it looketh back after its Mother, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hich a Glaſſe is a true Example, which is water and fire, and it receiveth the Image very plainely.</p>
                     <p n="284">284. And thus you ſee, that the End goeth back againe, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the beginning and no further<note n="g" place="margin">Or <hi>outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
                        </note> in the outward. For this world hath a limit, and is included in Time, and haſteneth to the limit, and there the End findeth the beginning, and this world is as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell or Glaſſe in the Beginning: by this you may finde ſomewhat of the Myſterie, and behave your ſelves well in the beginning, that you may be found to be a wonder in the Love of God.</p>
                     <p n="285">285. And know that the ſecond<note n="h" place="margin">Or <hi>Forme.</hi>
                        </note> kinde of water is in the Spirit, it is the Glaſſe of its father, of its maker, which dwelleth in the Spirit, and is found onely by its Maker, it ſelfe findeth not it ſelfe: for ſo long as a thing goeth<note n="i" place="margin">Outward.</note> forward, there is no finding in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but the Spirit which dwelleth in the inward, that findeth it ſelfe in the outward.</p>
                     <p n="286">286. Yet the outward life findeth not the inward, unleſſe it have the Spirit of the inward; and then it findeth by the inward Spirit, and ſo the outward life ſpeaketh of the inward, and knoweth it not; but the inward Spirit filleth the outward, ſo that the outward is as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:171923:32"/> it were a mouth, and the Inward hath, and produceth the Word, and ſo the Inward Kingdome is manifeſt in the outward by the ſound: which is a Wonder.</p>
                     <p n="287">287. The Inward is a Prophet: and the outward apprehendeth it not, but if he doe apprehend it, he hath the Eſſentiality of God in him, that is, the Divine fleſh, Chriſts fleſh, the fleſh of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and yet the Prophet is in the Spirit, but that fleſh receiveth his power and vertue, and aſſureth the outward Man that he doth nothing but what his Maker will have done, and ſuch a condition this pen is in, and no otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p n="288">288. And thus we know the<note n="k" place="margin">Foundation.</note> Ground of this world, that it is a figure of the Inward according to both the Mothers, that is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to both the Fires, <hi>viz.</hi> according to the fire of Wrath, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fire of Light; The Sun is a<note n="l" place="margin">Or <hi>Idea,</hi> or <hi>inſtance.</hi>
                        </note> Modell or Glaſſe of the Light of Eternity, and the outward fire is a Glaſſe of the Wrath, and the Eſſentiality of them both is Water and Earth: the<note n="m" place="margin">Reſembleth the Father.</note> Earth is the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiality of Wrath, and the<note n="n" place="margin">The Sonne.</note> water of the Light, and the<note n="o" place="margin">The Holy Ghoſt.</note> Aire of the Eternall Spirit; which is called, God, the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p n="289">289. Yet you muſt know, that this world is not the Eſſence of Eternity, but a figure, or a Glaſſe of it; therefore it is ſaid to be a peculiar<note n="p" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> third Principle.</note> Principle, becauſe it hath its owne life, and yet conſiſteth only in the Magick ſeeking of the Inward.</p>
                     <p n="290">290. The<note n="q" place="margin">Verbum Fiat.</note> Word <hi>Fiat,</hi> is the<note n="r" place="margin">

                           <hi>Or</hi> is like a wheele that turneth round.</note> turneth round; for the end continually ſeeketh the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and when it findeth the Wonders, then the End giveth the Wonders to the beginning, and this is the cauſe of the Creation of this world.</p>
                     <p n="291">291. The life of every Creature was a Wonder before the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for the Abyſſe knew nothing of it: and the beginning of the Eye findeth all, and ſetteth the Modell in it ſelfe, ſo that it hath an Eternall number, and delighteth it ſelfe in the number of the Wonders.</p>

                     <p n="294">294. My outward Man is not worthy of the Myſterie; but God hath ſo prepared it, that he might reveale himſelfe to you by that meanes, that you ſhould know him by ſome other meanes, and not ſay my wit hath done it.</p>

You ſhall not finde this plant among the high ones of this world; for<note n="c" place="margin">You have no power with them.</note> you cannot, you are a Myſterie to them: the Spirit it ſelfe ſeeketh the beginning: looke to it, play not the Hypocrite; (for the beginning is Paradiſicall:) that the impure enter not into the pure, and at laſt the Serpent beguile <hi>Eve</hi> againe.</p>

                     <p n="304">304. But ſeeing it is naked, and without Eſſence; therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Fire, for it putteth it ſelfe into it, and in the fire is a Deſire to ſeeke its owne body againe, and ſo the<note n="i" place="margin">

                     <p n="309">309. And thus wee underſtand the ſoule, to be a life awakened out of the Eye of God, its Originall is in the fire, and the fire is its life: but if it goe not forth out of the fire with its will and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Light, (<hi>viz.</hi> through the wrathfull Death into the ſecond Principle, into the fire of Love;) then it remaineth in its owne originall fire, and hath nothing for a body but the <hi>Turba; viz.</hi> the<note n="*" place="margin">Aſtringent.</note> harſh wrath in the Deſire in the fire, a conſuming, and a hunger: and yet an Eternall ſeeking, which is an eternall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</p>

                     <p n="311">311. But the ſoules which have awakened the <hi>Turba<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> they have loſt the Image; for the <hi>Turba</hi> hath devoured it: and therefore ſuch ſoules get beſtiall Images in the Wrath, and in Hell, according as the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> is in them: as <hi>Lucifer</hi> gat the Image of a Serpent: as the Will was figured here in this life; it remaineth then<note n="o" place="margin">

                     <p n="312">312. For the wrathfull <hi>Turba</hi> alwayes ſeeketh the Image, but findeth it not, and therefore it figureth the Image according to the Will: for the Earthly deſires ſtick in the will: and that Image re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the Wonders of God, in the Eye of the wrathfull Principle.</p>

                     <p n="323">323. But the Eternall life conſiſteth in Meekneſſe, and hath no Death or <hi>Turba</hi> in it; therefore we muſt ſay, that the ſoule and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are not in the <hi>Turba,</hi> eſpecially the<note n="t" place="margin">Or <hi>Image.</hi>

                     <p n="344">344 For we are a Creature, and ſhould ſpeake but ſo farre as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to a Creature to know, in the inward and outward, in body and ſoule, in God, Angels, Men and Devills; alſo in Beaſts, Fowles, Wormes, in Plants and Graſſe, in Heaven and Hell, all this wee are able to found, but not our owne Making.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. And God having created the third Principle, (which is a Glaſſe of the Deity) before the ſoule was created; and ſo that Glaſſe clave already to the Eternall<note n="r" place="margin">Glaſſe.</note>; for it was borne out of the Eternall Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſo was created: and therefore the third Principle would not leave the ſoule free, ſeeing it alſo was created out of the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of God, and ſtood in the beginning as a figure in the wiſdome of God; and deſired (being it ſelfe was materiall,) to have a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall ſimilitude in the ſoule: and therefore (in the Creation of the ſoule) it ſtirred up its owne ſpirit alſo together in the <hi>Fiat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence the outward Image according to the Spirit of this world, with the outward <hi>Fiat</hi> was<note n="ſ" place="margin">contrived, <hi>or</hi> formed.</note> conceived, and a body was created out of the<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Matrix of the Earth: a Maſſe of Red Earth conſiſting of fire and water.<note n="r" place="margin">

                  <p n="9">9. And the outward Spirit (<hi>viz.</hi> the Aire) and the whole out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Principle, with the Starres and Elements did cleave to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the outward Spirit breathed its life<note n="d" place="margin">At the ſame time.</note> in the ſame manner with the ſoule, through the noſtrills into the Heart, into the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Heart, into the<note n="e" place="margin">

                  <p n="10">10.

                  <p n="11">11. And it could Rule powerfully over the outward Principle, if its will were entred againe into the Heart of God, into the word of the Lord.</p>

                  <p n="2">2.

                     </note> reſembleth a ſprouting through the fire, through the Anguiſh as through Death, and yet it is no Death, but a going forth out of it ſelfe into another ſource: ſtanding thus in the midſt between the two bowes, as a ſprout ſpringing out of the Croſſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And the Arme of the Croſſe at the right hand, ſignifieth that the Spirit of the ſoule, entreth into the Majeſtie of the Light, and cloatheth the ſoule, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Centre,) with Divine Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Arme at the left hand of the Croſſe ſignifieth, that its originall is in the Fire, and it containeth the firſt Principle, and ſo belongeth to the Father: and ſtandeth in the Originall Eye, in the ſtrong and eager power, as a Lord and Ruler over Nature.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And the nether part of the Croſſe repreſenteth water: <hi>viz.</hi> humility or Death: ſignifying that it ſhould not domineere in the Fire, and enflame it ſelfe, but ſhould ſinke downe in it ſelfe, and under it ſelfe before the Majeſty of God, and be as it were dead in its will, that God may live in it, and the Holy Ghoſt leade and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne it, ſo that it may not doe what the <hi>Turba</hi> in the fire will: but what the Will in<note n="n" place="margin">Or <hi>Love.</hi>

                  <p n="11">11. The ſoule is the ſtock or Root, reſembling the Centre of the Ternarie, which is like an Eye, a Globe, a Croſſe, and its will (which proceedeth from the Eternall will) is a Spirit: which hath the true ſoule<note n="p" place="margin">Or <hi>under.</hi>

                  <p n="14">14. And herein it is the true Image of God alſo, for the Holy Ghoſt dwelleth in the Spirit of it, if it be faithfull: if not, then the Devill dwelleth in it: to which of theſe it giveth it ſelfe, either to Covetouſneſſe, and haughtineſſe, or to love and humility, to that it belongeth.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. When God created the Soule, then the Holy Ghoſt<note n="i" place="margin">Or <hi>encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>

                     </note> naked, and is cloathed when it hath the Tincture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But you underſtand, that the growing proceedeth from the warmth, that is the driver forth of the Tincture, it driveth the twig out of its roote, <hi>viz.</hi> out of its owne Fire, be it cold or hot fire.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For Darkeneſſe hath the cold fire, ſo long till it attaineth the Anguiſh, and then it kindleth it ſelfe in the heat, as you ſee in an Hearb, if it come into another<note n="l" place="margin">Or <hi>Source.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. And thus we give you to underſtand, that the Tincture is the true Body of the ſoule: for the ſoule is Fire; and the Tincture ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the Fire: the fire draweth it againe into it ſelfe, and allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe therewith, ſo that the wrathfull ſource is quenched and then the Tincture ſubſiſteth in meekneſſe.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. For, the fire is deſirous, and where there is a deſiring of the Originall, there is alſo a finding of the Originall, thus the fire find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth water in the Tincture, and turneth it into Sulphur, according to the power of all the ſeven Spirits of Nature: and this is<note n="n" place="margin">Or <hi>the.</hi>

For, the Tincture ſpringeth up in the water like a ſprout, and the fire in the Abyſſe cauſeth it: and ſo the water in the Sulphur of the ſeven Spirits is turned into the Myſterie; for, the Great<note n="o" place="margin">Arcanum.</note> Secret, what God and the Eternity can doe, lyeth therein.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And thus the Myſterie containeth two formes, <hi>viz.</hi> fire and water, and changeth it ſelfe according to them both, <hi>viz.</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to fire, into Red, and according to the Tincture into White;<note n="p" place="margin">This white.</note> this is a ſplendour or Glance of the Fire, by which the Life may ſee and know it ſelfe, from whence Reaſon and the ſenſes ariſe: And the Minde is in the wheele of the Anguiſh in the Fire, out of which the Eſſences ariſe.</p>

                  <p n="12">12. For Sul is the vertue of the Light: and Phur is the vertue of the foure Formes of the Originall of Nature; as is mentioned at large in the third Booke.</p>

                  <p n="14">14.

                  <p n="15">15. For, the firſt ſoule was incorporated with the Divine Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality together in the Tincture, ſo that it had the Divine body in the virgine of Wiſdome, in which the Tincture ſtandeth, which is the Angelicall Image.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And ſo wee anſwer you, that as to the ſoule onely beſide the Spirit; it is a Globe of Fire, with an Eye of Fire, and an Eye of Light, which turne themſelves backwards into one another, as the wheele in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> that could goe on every ſide: though <hi>Babell</hi> hath contrived another meaning about it, but a blinde one without Spirit.</p>

                  <p n="18">18. As to the ſoule onely; the body belongeth not to the Eſſence of the ſoule, they are two ſeverall Eſſences: for the body is the Glaſſe and dwelling houſe of the ſoule, alſo its<note n="u" place="margin">Inheritance, owne Lands, <hi>or</hi> goods, <hi>or</hi> poſſeſſion.</note> Proprietary, and it is alſo a cauſe, that the<note n="x" place="margin">Or <hi>poore.</hi>

                  <p n="19">19. Whereby the Image in the Spirit is altered altogether, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Contence of the Will, which the ſoule hath<note n="y" place="margin">Or <hi>created,</hi> or <hi>formed.</hi>
                     </note> brought out of the Centre of Fire, alſo out of the Wrath into the Light, and all according to the Imagination.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. You know what is written in our third Booke, very punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and at large, with many Circumſtances concerning its Propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; how <hi>Adam</hi> was created one Image, he was both Man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man before <hi>Eve,</hi> he had both the Tincture of the fire, and of the water; that is, ſoule and Spirit, and he ſhould have brought forth his ſimilitude out of himſelfe, an Image<note n="e" place="margin">After, <hi>or</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording.</note> of himſelfe, out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by his Imagination and his owne Love, and that he was able to doe without rending of the body.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For, as we have mentioned before, the ſoule had<note n="f" place="margin">might <hi>or</hi> abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> power to change the body into another forme; and ſo alſo it had power to bring forth a Twig out of it ſelfe, according to its property, if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood out in the<note n="g" place="margin">Proba, <hi>or</hi> Temptation.</note> Triall.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. And ſo the Noble Image was found in the Earthly, and then deſtruction and Death began, and <hi>Adam</hi> could not<note n="i" place="margin">Beget, <hi>or</hi> beare.</note> bring forth, for his Omnipotence was loſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And ſhould indeed have ever been loſt, if the Heart of God had not inſtantly turned it ſelfe, with the word of the Promiſe into <hi>Adams</hi> ſoule; which did ſo preſerve it, that its Image muſt periſh,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:171923:43"/> and the ſoule muſt ſinke downe with the Heavenly body through death into the new Life, where its Spirit will be renewed againe.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And thus <hi>Adam</hi> in<note n="k" place="margin">Inability <hi>or</hi> weakneſſe.</note> impotence fell aſleep: and then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Creation began, for God tooke the Tincture of the Water; as a twig out of <hi>Adams</hi> ſoule, and a Rib out of <hi>Adam,</hi> and halfe of the Croſſe that was in <hi>Adam,</hi> and<note n="l" place="margin">

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="6">6.

MY beloved friend; this is a very<note n="b" place="margin">ſublime, <hi>or</hi> ſharp, <hi>or</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</note> deep Queſtion; yet you ſhall be anſwered: for the time of the manifeſtation is borne, the Day breaketh, the Night is paſt; therefore eternall prayſe and thankes be given to God, that hath againe begotten us to light, and to an inheritance that never fadeth away; and hath received us for his beloved Children.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. My beloved friend, you know well the heavie fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> as we have ſhewen you copiouſly in all our writings, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſoule hath turned it ſelfe away with the right Eye, from God into the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this world, and is become diſobedient to God, and hath wholly depraved its Noble Image, and changed it into a monſtrous Image; and hath let in the Spirit of this world, whereas it ſhould have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully ruled over it with the will, and not have let the ſoule eat of evill, and good at all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But now it hath plainely tranſgreſſed Gods<note n="c" place="margin">pleaſure.</note> Command, and hath put its Imagination into the Earthly Spirit, where the <hi>Turba</hi> which brought the Earthly Monſter into its Noble Image, inſtantly tooke it captive, and ſo the <hi>Turba</hi> inſtantly ſought, and found the Limit, in which the Image periſhed; and if the Word had not<note n="d" place="margin">Set it ſelfe in the middeſt.</note> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated, or interpoſed it ſelfe, it would have continued ſo for ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And ſo, now the <hi>Turba</hi> is once ſeated in the Earthly Abyſſe, and hath captivated both body and ſoule, it alwayes driveth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the limit, and there deſtroyeth it, and caſteth it away, and then the poore ſoule remaineth Naked without a Body.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And except it turne with its Right Eye againe into the Word, and get againe a body borne out of God, it is but naked, and hath the <hi>Turba</hi> in it; which ſtirreth up the fire in its great Anguiſh: for<note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Viz.</hi> the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba.</note> it is an eager hunger, a ſeeker, and a finder.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now it is throughly knowne to us, that our ſoule is faſt bound to the Spirit of this world, for the <hi>Turba</hi> holdeth us captive in the Wrath of the Anger of God.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And although our ſoule get out, and become New-borne in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:171923:49"/> God, yet<note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Turba.</note> it poſſeſſeth the outward body ſtill, and conſumeth it, for it pierceth through it even to the Abyſſe, and there it findeth that it is onely a Glaſſe of the Eternall, and then it goeth forth from the Glaſſe into the Eternall, and lets the body lie in the Nothing.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Alſo you know well; that the ſoule, with the body in the ſeed, is halfe Earthy: for it is Sulphur, that is,<note n="g" place="margin">Phur is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Matter, <hi>or</hi> ſubſtance.</note> Phur and<note n="h" place="margin">Sul is Spirit, <hi>or</hi> Light.</note> Sul<note n="i" place="margin">In one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the <hi>Turba</hi> is in it, which hath ability enough to deſtroy the ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. How then can a ſoule be borne pure? it cannot be, it bringeth the <hi>Turba</hi> with it into the world, and is ſinfull in the Mothers<note n="k" place="margin">Or <hi>body.</hi>
                     </note> wombe.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But know that God is become Man, and the Word <hi>Fiat</hi> hath agiane put it ſelfe into the ſeed; and although the <hi>Turba</hi> be now in the Earthly part, ſo that the ſeed is not altogether free, yet the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtands thus with the ſoule.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The ſoule is not wholly forſaken of God, ſo farre as the Father and Mother are<note n="l" place="margin">Or <hi>vertuous.</hi>
                     </note> honeſt, and in God; for it cometh from the ſoule of the Father, and of the Mother: and although a Childe dye in the Mothers wombe without<note n="m" place="margin">Externall Baptiſme.</note> Baptiſme, yet it is baptized with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Father, and of the Mother, <hi>viz.</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt which dwelleth in them, and the <hi>Turba</hi> is deſtroyed in Death; for the<note n="n" place="margin">That which belongeth to Faith.</note> Faiths-part paſſeth through to God.</p>
                  <p n="12">12.

                  <p n="13">13. And yet it doth not by this reach to the inflammation, for that ſoule it ſelfe hath not yet committed<note n="p" place="margin">Actuall.</note> ſinne; but it is a ſpirit in the ſource, quite voyde of ſelfe-deſire, and wonders, it is like bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Brimſtone, like the<note n="q" place="margin">Wandring falſe Lights, that lead peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſtray in the night. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="15">15. Thus we give you to underſtand, that no ſoule is borne into this world without ſinne, how honeſt ſoever the Parents be; for it is<note n="t" place="margin">Auſgebru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet, <hi>engendred,</hi> or <hi>hatched.</hi>

                  <p n="16">16. Therefore God made a Covenant with Children in the Old Teſtament, in the Circumciſion, and bound them in that Covenant to have their bloud ſhed, and ſo drowne the <hi>Turba</hi> of the ſoule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>

                  <p n="20">20. Is not this <hi>Babell?</hi> which hath confounded the whole world, ſo that People have divided themſeves in Opinions, and yet in the Will they goe but one way; what cauſed this but onely the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, when he<note n="x" place="margin">Tooke Gods Government upon himſelfe.</note> drew the Kingdome of God into his owne Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and made a meere fable of the New-birth, which very Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will be aſhamed of, when it ſhall be day?</p>
                  <p n="21">21.

                  <p n="1">1. AS it is mentioned before, ſo it is: the <hi>Turba</hi> with the Earthly<note n="c" place="margin">Seeking, <hi>or</hi> longing.</note> Deſire come together into this world, and ſo the ſoule is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawne by two; <hi>viz.</hi> by the<note n="d" place="margin">Verbum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</note> Word of the Lord, which media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or interpoſed it ſelfe, which out of Love is become Man; this draweth the ſoule continually into the Kingdome of God, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth the ſoule the <hi>Turba;</hi> ſo that the ſoule ſeeth in Nature what falſhood and ſinne is, and if it yield it ſelfe to be drawn,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:171923:50"/> then it becommeth borne againe, and ſo beommeth Gods Image.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, the <hi>Turba</hi> alſo mightily draweth the ſoule with its band, and continually bringeth the Earthly deſire into it, eſpecially in the youth; when the Earthly Tree ſticketh full of greene ſprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Eſſences and Poyſon: then the <hi>Turba</hi> doth ſo mightily inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it ſelfe, that many a ſoule is not freed to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In a thing which hath its riſe from two beginnings, being of equall weight, one part will ſinke downe, if weight be added to it, be it either good, or evill that is added.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sinne maketh not it ſelfe, but the will maketh it, it commeth from the Imagination into the Spirit: for the Spirit entreth into a thing, and is infected by that thing, and ſo the <hi>Turba</hi> of that thing commeth into the Spirit, and firſt deſtroyeth the Image of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And the <hi>Turba</hi> proceedeth further, and ſearcheth deeper, and ſo it findeth the Abyſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſoule; and ſeeketh in the ſoule, and ſo findeth the wrathfull Fire, by which it mingleth it ſelfe with the thing, that is ſo introduced into the Spirit, and thus at length ſinne is wholly borne: Now therefore whatſoever deſireth to bring that which is outward into the Will, that is ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The will ought to incline to nothing, but to meekneſſe and Love, as if it were a Nothing, or Dead: wee ſhould onely deſire to live to God, ſo that God may worke in us, and whatſoever wee doe beſides; our will muſt be directed ſo, that we doe it to God.</p>

But if we ſet our will upon the<note n="e" place="margin">Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>or</hi> earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire, <hi>viz.</hi> Pride, Goods, Power, and Honour.</note> Eſſence, then wee bring the Eſſence into the Spirit, and that taketh poſſeſſion of our Heart: and then the <hi>Turba</hi> is borne, and the ſoule is captivated by the thing.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And therefore we <hi>Anſwer;</hi> that no ſoule commeth pure from the Mothers<note n="f" place="margin">Or <hi>body.</hi>

And as the Abyſſe and the Anger of God, and alſo the earthly world depend wholly on God the Father; and yet cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and touch his Heart and Spirit: ſo it is alſo with the Childe in the Mothers wombe, if it be begotten by godly Parents, then each Principle<note n="g" place="margin">

                  <p n="1">1. WE have mentioned before, that there are three Principles, which are all three in the ſoule, already beforehand, and are in one another, as one thing: and you muſt underſtand that the ſtrife in the ſoule beginneth before, in the ſeed, while it lyeth hidden in both Sexes, in the Man and Woman; when alſo the <hi>Turba</hi> ſtirreth up it ſelfe before, in that it driveth the Eſſence of the ſeed to a falſe Imagination, to a falſe Deſire.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Although the Spirit tameth the body, yet it imagineth, and this the <hi>Turba</hi> cauſeth in the ſeed, and no man can well deny, but that many times this Imagination is offenſive to him, and where there is a right Spirit, it wiſheth it<note n="h" place="margin">Exeommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated.</note> anathematiſed: And you muſt know, that the ſpirit of the ſoule ſticketh thus in a miſerable ſtrait, and cannot be looſed, untill the <hi>Turba</hi> taketh the Body.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now there is never any union between the outward, and the Regenerate Man; the outward man would alwayes devoure the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, for they are in one another, but each hath its owne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, ſo that the outward cannot over-maſter the Inward, if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doe but continue<note n="i" place="margin">

For, the outward is a Beaſt, and belongeth not to the Inward; but its wonders which it hath brought forth out of the Inward, and which it hath opened in the comprehenſible Eſſence, they belong in their figure, (not in their Eſſence) to the Inward: the Inward Spirit muſt receive theſe (which are Gods workes of Wonder,) for they ſhall be the joy of it for ever.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And thus we ſay, that the ſoule may be kept very well in the New Man, if the Spirit of its Tincture, doe but hinder its<note n="p" place="margin">Seeking, <hi>or</hi> Deſire.</note> Longing and Imagination: and although the outward Spirit be beſtiall, yet the Inward underſtanding [Spirit] is able to keepe in, and tame the outward, for it is Lord over it: But he that ſuffereth the Beſtiall Spirit to be Lord, he is a Beaſt, and hath alſo a Beſtiall Image in the inward Figure, in the Tincture.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And he that letteth the Fire-Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Turba,</hi> be Lord, he is an<note n="q" place="margin">Subſtantiall, <hi>or</hi> Devill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canrate.</note> Eſſentiall Devill, in the Inward Image: therefore here it is neceſſary, that the outward Spirit powre<note n="r" place="margin">Viz. <hi>humility.</hi>

                  <p n="11">11. Now if we conſider our ſelves in the<note n="u" place="margin">Of the Old, and New man together.</note> union, the outward Spirit is very profitable to us, for many ſoules would periſh, if the Beſtiall Spirit were not: which beholdeth the Fire captive, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before the Fire-Spirit earthly beſtiall Labour and Joy, wherein it may buiſie it ſelfe, till it be able by the<note n="x" place="margin">Or workes.</note> Wonders, in the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to diſcover ſomewhat of its Noble Image, that it may ſeeke it ſelfe againe.</p>

                  <p n="13">13. God knew how it went with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and alſo what the great Eternall<note n="z" place="margin">

                  <p n="14">14. Alſo many a ſoule by its wickedneſſe would become a Devill in a<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> the twinckling of an Eye.</note> moment, if the outward life did not hinder it, ſo that the ſoule cannot wholly inflame it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. How many are there that are ſo full of poyſon, and<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> malice, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> evill, that they doe murther and commit villany: but this their Fire hath water, or elſe they were paſt remedy: As ye ſee in gall which is a fiery poyſon, but it is mingled with water, and ſo the violence of the fire is allayed.</p>

                  <p n="17">17. Moreover, the outward Spirit could not have life without this Fire, ſeeing it hath fire in all Creatures, but this Fire is onely the wrath of the Inward fire.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. The Inward fire conſumeth earth and ſtones, alſo the body and bloud, yea, even the Noble Image, if it be<note n="c" place="margin">Or <hi>kindled.</hi>

                     <hi>The ſeventeenth Queſtion.</hi> Whence, and wherefore is the Contrariety between the Spirit and the Fleſh?</head>
                  <p n="1">1. MY beloved friend; you know well, that fire and water are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: for the fire is Life, and the water is its Death, and you ſee plainely, that when water is poured upon the Fire, the ſource of the Fire goeth out, and ſo the Fire is dead.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And although in Man [the fire] is not wholly dead becauſe of the Light, which continually cauſeth fire, yet there is an enmity; as there is an enmity between God and Hell; and yet Hell, or the Fire of wrath is Gods.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And Gods Majeſty would not be manifeſted, if his Anger were not, which ſharpneth the darke hiddenneſſe of Eternity, by the wrath of Nature, ſo that it is changed into Fire, whence the high Light in the free Eternity is brought forth, which maketh a Majeſty in the milde ſource.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And yet the Fire is the onely cauſe, that there is a<note n="d" place="margin">Or <hi>life,</hi> or <hi>working.</hi>
                     </note> ſource in the Light, in the Meekneſſe; for the Light proceedeth from the Glance of the fire, and hath the ſource of the Fire in it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But the Will (as is mentioned before) ſinketh downe in the Anguiſh, even into Death, and ſpringeth againe afreſh in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and this is the Light which hath the<note n="e" place="margin">Or <hi>property.</hi>
                     </note> ſource of the Fire; but yet it hath another Principle in it, for the Anguiſh is become Love.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. After this manner alſo it is in the Body, where the fleſh ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:171923:52"/> againſt the Spirit: the Life of the outward fleſh is a Glaſſe of the moſt Inward fire life, <hi>viz.</hi> of the life of the ſoule; and the life of the Spirit of the Soule, with the Light of the Tincture, is the middlemoſt Life, and yet it is borne out of the ſoule.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But underſtand our depth aright: the Spirit of the ſoule, wherein the Divine Image confiſtech, ariſeth in the fire, and is firſt of all, the will to the Fire, but when the<note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> wrathfull deſire, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the fire.</note> wrath in the fire is ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and inflamed, then the Will commeth into a great anguiſh, like a dying, and ſinketh downe in it ſelfe, out of the wrath into the Eternall Liberty; and yet there is no dying, but<note n="g" place="margin">Or <hi>ſecond.</hi>
                     </note> another world thus commeth out of the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For, then the Will ſpringeth up in the other world, as a ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe out of the Fire: yet it is without any ſuch<note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> Aking property.</note> Anguiſh ſource in the Eternall Liberty: and it is a moving, a driving and an<note n="i" place="margin">Or <hi>feeling.</hi>
                     </note> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the Anguiſhing Nature; it hath all the<note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> ſpringing vertues.</note> Eſſences, which in the firſt ſharpe fire-world are brought forth in the Anguiſh; but they are like one, that goeth out of Fire into water: and ſo the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of the fire is left in the water.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. You muſt underſtand that this Life is the Life of the Spirit of the ſoule: the ſoule is the Centre of Nature, and the Spirit is the precious and noble Image, which God created for his Image; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſtandeth the High,<note n="l" place="margin">Or <hi>Kingly.</hi>
                     </note> Royall, and precious Image of God: for, God is thus, he is comprehended in the ſame ſource of Life.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The Spirit is not parted from the ſoule, no, as you ſee Fire and Light are not parted, and yet are not one, they have a twofold<note n="m" place="margin">Or <hi>Quality.</hi>
                     </note> Source: the Fire is wrathfull, the Light is Milde and Lovely: in the Light is the Life, and in the Fire, the cauſe of the Life.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And thus without much ſeeking you may finde, the cauſe of the Contrariety, that is between the fleſh and the Spirit: for, the inward Spirit hath the<note n="n" place="margin">

                  <p n="12">12. The Inward Spirit would be Maſter, for it tameth the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſo alſo the outward would be Maſter, for it ſaith, I have the Great Wonders, and the <hi>Arcanum,</hi> thus it braggeth of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and yet it is but a Glaſſe of the Myſterie.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. It is not the Eſſence of the Myſterie, but a<note n="ſ" place="margin">Seeking, <hi>or</hi> longing.</note> Deſire, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Glaſſe, in which the Myſtery is beheld, but it would

                  <p n="14">14. Therefore beloved Brother, if you would ſeeke the Myſtery, ſeeke it not in the outward Spirit, you will be deceived, and attaine nothing, but a glance of the Myſtery: enter in even to the Croſſe, then ſeeke Gold and you will not be deceived, you muſt ſeeke in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world for the pure Childe that is without ſpot, in this world you finde onely the droſſy Childe, that is altogether imperfect, but goe about it in a right manner.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Goe back from the Croſſe into the fourth forme, and there you have <hi>Sol,</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> together, bring that in Anguiſh into Death, and bruiſe that compoſed Magicall body ſo long, till it become a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that which it was before the Centre in the Will; and then it becommeth<note n="t" place="margin">Deſirous.</note> Magicall and hungry after Nature.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. It is a<note n="u" place="margin">Or <hi>ſeeking.</hi> or <hi>Deſire.</hi>
                     </note> longing in the Eternall Longing, and would faine have a body, therefore give it <hi>Sol, viz.</hi> the Soule;<note n="x" place="margin">

                  <p n="17">17. There you have the Noble Childe, yee covetous gripers, wee muſt indeed tell this to you, ſeeing it is borne with it; but thoſe onely that are of our Tribe will underſtand us.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. For, wee meane not here a<note n="y" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> ſimilitude, figure, <hi>or</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</note> Glaſſe or Heaven; but Gold wherewith you vaunt, which for ſo long a time hath been your Idoll-God: and your blinde<note n="z" place="margin">

                  <p n="19">19. We ſpeake here wonderfully, yet we ſpeake nothing but what we muſt ſpeake: Let none marvell, that he knoweth the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, who hath not learnt it from any man; doth not an hearb grow without your<note n="a" place="margin">Or <hi>direction.</hi>
                     </note> Counſell, neither doth it inquire for your Art: yea the Myſterie is growne alſo without your Art, it hath its owne ſchoole; like the Apoſtles on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> who ſpake with many Languages and Tongues without premeditation and Art, and ſo is this ſimplicity in like manner.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And this foretelleth thy Fall O <hi>Babell,</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">That you may be warned of it.</note> that thou mayeſt know it: no wrath nor Anger will help you; the Starre is borne which leadeth the<note n="c" place="margin">Magi.</note> wiſemen out of the Eaſt-Country: but ſeek thou onely where thou art, and finde thy ſelfe; and caſt the<note n="d" place="margin">Wrangling, malice, and Tyranny.</note> 
                     <hi>Turba</hi> from thee, and then thou ſhalt live with the Children, this we tell thee in good earneſt, there is no other Remedy: thy Anger is thy fire which will deſtroy thy ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Or doſt thou thinke that we are blinde? if we did ſee nothing we would ſtill be ſilent; what pleaſure would a lye be to God? yea
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:171923:53"/> we ſhould be found in the <hi>Turba,</hi> which ſearcheth through all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Eſſences and workes: or doe wee this piece of ſervice for Wages? is it our<note n="e" place="margin">Or <hi>trade.</hi>
                     </note> living? why doe we not minde our bread onely according to outward Reaſon?</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing it is our Day-labour, wee muſt doe what the Father will, for we muſt give an account thereof at the evening, this we ſpeak ſeriouſly, and in good earneſt.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Thus you may well underſtand the Contrariety of fleſh, and Spirit, and finde very well, that two Spirits are in one another, one ſtriving againſt the other, for one deſireth God, the other deſireth bread; and both are profitable and good.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. But thou childe of Man, let this be ſpoken to thee, lead thy life circumſpectly, and let the Spirit of thy ſoule be Maſter, and then thou wilt have fought here a good fight, for this time is but ſhort.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. We all ſtand here in the field and grow: let every one have a care, what fruit he beareth; for at the end of the Harveſt every worke ſhall be put into its owne Granary.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. It is better to labour a little while with toyle and care, in the vineyard, and to waite for the great wages and Refreſhment, then to be a King here for a little time, and afterwards to be a Lyon, a Wolfe, a Dog, a Cat, a Toad, Serpent or worme; in<note n="f" place="margin">Or <hi>ſhape.</hi>

                  <p n="29">29. Pray be the Children of God; and be not Devills: Let not the Hypocrites keepe you back by their<note n="h" place="margin">Or <hi>Example.</hi>

                  <p n="32">32.

                  <p n="33">33. If you would ſerve God, you muſt doe it in the New man, the Earthly <hi>Adam</hi> can doe him no acceptable ſervice, let him ſing, roare, call, confeſſe, pray, crye, and doe what ever he will, all is but fighting with a ſhadow, the will muſt be in it, the Heart muſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reſigne it ſelfe up into it, elſe it is but a fained babble, and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Antichriſts, wherewith the whole Earth is filled.</p>

                  <p n="35">35.

                  <p n="5">5. Now if all Eſſences have proceeded from one, then the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is alſo in the laſt Eſſence; for the laſt is<note n="q" place="margin">Or <hi>retired.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. Thus we give you to underſtand what dying is: the beginning ſeeketh the Limit, and when it findeth it, then it caſteth away the ſeeking, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earthly Life, that ſhall be caſt away, it muſt break off it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For, the beginning (<hi>viz.</hi> the ſoule) continueth in the Limit: and letteth the body periſh, there is no complaining about it, neither doth the ſoule deſire it any more: it muſt goe alſo into its limit, <hi>viz.</hi> into the Wonders of that which it hath been.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. For the Spirit of the ſoule grieveth not when the body<note n="ſ" place="margin">

                  <p n="10">10. The figure continueth ſtill in the will, for the will cannot be deſtroyed: and thus the ſoule muſt continue in the will, and it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the figure inſtead of matter, and burneth in the will; for the firſt glowing of the fire doth not paſſe away; but it is quite deprived of the mater of the Earthly Life, <hi>viz.</hi> of the<note n="t" place="margin">Subſtance, <hi>or</hi> droſſe.</note>

                  <p n="15">15. Thus we may perceive that the<note n="d" place="margin">

                  <p n="17">17. And if the fire of the ſoule hath not the Divine body in the Spirit, nor in the Will in the Deſire, then it is a darke fire, which burneth in anguiſh and great horrour: for it hath nothing but the firſt foure formes of Nature in Anguiſh.</p>
                  <p n="18">18.

For, the body retaineth it not, no wood, no ſtone, can<note n="l" place="margin">comprehend, incloſe, keepe, <hi>or</hi> withold it.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, it is thinner then the Aire, and if it have the Divine Body, then it goeth ſtrait as a Conquerour through the <hi>Turba, viz.</hi> through the Anger of God, and quite through Death, and when it is through, then it is in Gods<note n="m" place="margin">Or <hi>ſubſtance.</hi>
                     </note> Eſſence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It remaineth in its<note n="n" place="margin">Deedes, and</note> wonders and Eſſences, which it wrought here: It beholdeth the Majeſty of God, and the Angels, face to face.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whereſoever it is, it is in the Abyſſall world, where there is no End nor Limit: whither ſhould it goe? where the carkaſſe is there the Eagles gather together: It is in Chriſts fleſh and Bloud, with Chriſt its Shepheard.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though it ſhould goe a thouſand miles off, yet it were then in the ſame place from whence it went; for, in God there is no Limit; neere and farre off is all one.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is as ſwift as a Thought, it is Magicall, it dwelleth in its Wonders, they are its Houſe.</p>

                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:171923:57"/>7. The Eſſentiality that is without, it is Paradiſe, a ſpringing bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming, and growing of all manner of faire heavenly fruits; juſt as we have all kinds of fruit here in this world, which we eate after an Earthly manner; ſo alſo there are all manner of fruits in Paradiſe, which the ſoule may eate; they have colours and vertues in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and not like a thought: though they be as thin and ſubtile as a Thought, but ſubſtantiall, comprehenſible, and palpable to the ſoule, virtuall and ſappy with the water of Life, and all this from the heavenly ſubſtantiality.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For, the heavenly body of the ſoule is from the pure Element (whence the foure Elements are brought forth) and that giveth fleſh, and the Tincture giveth bloud: the heavenly man hath fleſh and bloud, and Paradiſe is the Power of the ſubſtantiality, it is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Earth, incomprehenſible to our outward Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But wee will againe teach you another A. B. C. All in this world have not Chriſts fleſh in them, hidden in the Old <hi>Adam,</hi> yea among very many, not one, but the Regenerate, who are departed from their owne will into Gods will, in whom the Noble Graine of Muſtard-ſeed is ſowne, out of which a Tree is growne.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Moſt ſoules depart from the body without Chriſts body: yet they hang as by a<note n="o" place="margin">The ſmall threed of Faith.</note> threed; and are at laſt in their Faith gotten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the will: theſe ſoules indeed are in the Image in the Spirit, but not in Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Such as theſe waite for the laſt Day; when the Image, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Body) ſhall come forth out of the Grave, out of the firſt Image, for God will raiſe it up by the voyce of Chriſt: even that Image which <hi>Adam</hi> had in his Innocency, which hath been waſhed with Chriſts Bloud.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But the Earthly Body ſhall not touch it: that muſt come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgement in the <hi>Turba;</hi> but after the Sentence of the Judgement, the <hi>Turba</hi> ſhall ſwallow it up, and the<note n="p" place="margin">Or <hi>workes.</hi>

                  <p n="13">13. You muſt underſtand us aright: Theſe ſoules that muſt waite till the the laſt Day for their Bodies, they remaine with their bodies in the ſtill Reſt, till the laſt day, without feeling any<note n="q" place="margin">Or <hi>Source.</hi>
                     </note> paine; but in another Principle.</p>

                  <p n="16">16. But a Spirit without a body hath not that<note n="t" place="margin">Or <hi>Power.</hi>

Thus my beloved friend, know that there is a difference of Places where ſoules are; according to that whereinto the ſoule is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; if it be Holy and Regenerate, then it hath a<note n="d" place="margin">The body of Chriſt.</note> Body, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth onely the<note n="e" place="margin">Or <hi>workes.</hi>
                     </note> Wonders of the body at the laſt Day; it hath<note n="f" place="margin">Conceived, <hi>or</hi> formed.</note> comprehended them already in the Will, but at the Day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it muſt ſtand before the Judgement.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. All ſoules good and bad ſhall every one receive their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Reward: The Holy ſhall be ſet in the preſence of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they may ſee and<note n="g" place="margin">Or <hi>taſte.</hi>

                  <p n="27">27. If any ſhould feigne a peculiar Reſidence, or place where they ſhould conſort or ſit together, that contradicts the Rule of the <hi>Magia:</hi> Every ſoule is in its owne Country, and not bound to the place of the body, but it may be where it will; whereſoever it is, it is, either in God, or in Darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. God is every where, and Darkneſſe is every where, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels alſo are every where, each in its owne Principle, and in its owne<note n="i" place="margin">Or <hi>ſoure.</hi>
                     </note> Property.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. The Fiction of outward Reaſon, without the knowledge of the Principles is<note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> a falſe Glaſſe, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</note> as a fighting with a ſhadow: If I ſhould aske a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, and ſhould alwayes be told ſomewhat from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and yet were but in fleſh and bloud, I ſhould looke upon it as <hi>Babell</hi> doth; which ſuppoſeth that the ſoule flyeth into a Heaven, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Starres; I know not that Heaven they ſpeake of, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not to come there.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Heaven is indeed above; but there are the Angelicall Ptinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and Thrones: This Eye of the<note n="l" place="margin">Skies Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>or</hi> Spheares.</note> Aether is our Principality, and Kingdome.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. The ſame is with them above which is with us, but our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Eſſence is in our Aether: A ſoule may come to them if it earneſtly deſireth, and the Angels of God will lovingly entertaine it.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. For, the ſame Eſſence of God which is with us, is with them; this onely is the difference; that they have among them Angelicall workes, wholly, pure without blemiſh, and we have the great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and therefore they long to be with us; and beſides they are our ſervants, during the life of the body, and withſtand the Devill.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Now if the Angels be in this world, in the Holy Principle; whither then ſhall the ſoule flie firſt might <hi>Babell</hi> thinke? perhaps into Pride as <hi>Lucifer</hi> did!

                  <p n="2">2. When a Darling-Sonne travelleth a farre off into a ſtrange Countrey, for Art and Honour: he often thinkes of home, and of the time, when he ſhall enjoy his Parents and friends, he rejoyceth at the thought of that Day, and expecteth it with inward joy and Longing: alſo he plyeth himſelfe hard in his buſineſſe, that he may get Arts and skill, wherewith he may make his Parents, kindred, and friends rejoyce.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thinke of this ſimilitude, and take it into conſideration: It is juſt ſo with the ſoule: the ſoules without<note n="o" place="margin">The body of Chriſt.</note> body have a great inward Joy; and waite for the laſt Day with great inward Deſire, when they ſhall againe receive its faire and Holy Body with its<note n="p" place="margin">

                  <p n="6">6. They that have ſuffered much Perſecution for the Truthes ſake, they ſee their bright<note n="r" place="margin">

                  <p n="8">8. They who have been ſcorned, contemned, perſecuted, and ſlaine for Chriſts Doctrine, honour, and Truths ſake, they ſee the Triumphant Victory, like one that hath overcome his Enemie in a fight, and then ſets it forth Triumphantly to his Prince or King, and for which he hath exceeding great Glory, when his King receiveth him with great joy: and keepes him with him for his faithfull aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant.</p>

We have no Pen that can write what exceeding joy is in them: onely this wee know, that thoſe for the moſt part, have put on the Divine Body in this world, and ſo have greater perfection then the other: they expect the laſt Day with great joy and Glory, when their workes ſhall be preſented to them, and ſet before their Eyes in heavenly figures, and the wicked ſhall ſee them<note n="ſ" place="margin">

                  <p n="10">10. Every ſoule rejoyceth before the face of God, in great hope of that which it ſhall receive againe, for it knoweth its Reward, but without the body it cannot receive it: for it hath wrought its workes in the Body, and therefore its workes follow it in the New body, and come to it againe.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. For, although the exceeding precious Holy ſoules have put on Chriſts body in this world, ſo that they ſtand in Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Image of God, yet all their workes were wrought in the Old Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which was Gods Glaſſe: and in the Reſurrection, they ſhall be repreſented in the true heavenly Figure, in<note n="t" place="margin">

But the <hi>Turba,</hi> with the outward Kingdome of the outward Source is gone, for<note n="x" place="margin">The firſt Image.</note> it was a Glaſſe, and is now become a Wonder, it liveth without Spirit as a Wonder, and ſhall be put upon the ſoule in great<note n="y" place="margin">Clarity, Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>or</hi> bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> Glory, which it ſhall have from the Light of God: at which the holy ſoules doe exceedingly rejoyce, and expect it with great longing.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. You muſt know that every bleſſed ſoule trimmeth its Lamp, ſo that it willingly meeteth its Bridegroome at the laſt Day: it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes reneweth its will, and thinketh how it ſhall rejoyce with all holy men and Angels, in its new Body in the Wonders: there is a continuall ſpringing up of Joy in them, when they thinke of that which is to come, each as it's vertues are.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And as their workes have been different upon Earth, ſo alſo is their hope: for, a Day-labourer, who hath wrought much, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth at his wages: ſo alſo here: there is a friendly Eſſence among them, and in them.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. All the ſcorne and diſgrace which was put upon them that were innocent, is a great Triumphant Glory to them, in that they have ſuffered in Innocency, and put on Patience in Hope; which they have ſtill on, Death cannot take it away, nor put it off, but the ſoule taketh that with it which it hath<note n="z" place="margin">Or <hi>wrought.</hi>

                  <p n="17">17. Its many hearty Prayers, wiſhes, and good deedes in love to its Neighbour, are its food which it eateth, and joyfully enjoyeth,

                  <p n="18">18. But they which have put on the Divine Body here, they eate at Gods Table without ceaſing: yet the Paradiſicall fruit belongeth to the body of the Wonders, which ſhall ariſe out of the Grave, and which was created in Paradiſe; for it was made out of the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and it bringeth the End with the<note n="a" place="margin">Or <hi>workes.</hi>

But wonder not, nor thinke that we underſtand it ſo, though we ſeeme to ſpeake of two bodies of the Holyeſt Saints; for they are not two, but one: But conſider, that Gods Eſſentiality filleth all, and that is the Divine Body, which is put upon the<note n="b" place="margin">The great Holy ſoules.</note> Holy ſoules, even in this life.</p>

                  <p n="25">25. Their expectation is like that of an impriſoned Malefactour, who continually liſtneth (when any thing ſtirreth) when the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner ſhould come, and execute Judgement, and give him his Reward: juſt ſo doe they.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. They have a falſe Conſcience, which gnaweth them, their ſins are ſet continually before them: they alſo ſee their workes Magical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: they ſee all their unrighteouſneſſe and vanities, their unmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pride and haughtineſſe; they ſee the oppreſſion of the poore; their ſcorning and ſuppreſſion of them.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Their falſe beliefe flieth from them, their Hypocriſie was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:171923:60"/> a deceitfull Glaſſe; it reached not the Heart of God; it ſtandeth viſibly before them in the Magick, <hi>viz.</hi> in their will: but when they ſearch therein, they ſtirre up the <hi>Turba</hi> of the Fire, which will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes conſume the Glaſſe, and then they are in feare and horrour.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. For, they ſee and know, that all muſt be tried at the laſt Day, by the Eternall fire of Gods Anger: and they feele very well that their workes will ſtay in the Fire.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. The Devills alſo exceedingly Tremble, when they conſider their fall: which reſts in Gods Judgement what he will doe; of which the Holy Scripture telleth us plainely enough: eſpecially the Judge, Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Thus know, that the totally miſerable condition of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is, that when they ſhould trim their Lamps, to meete their Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome at his comming, they tremble and ſmother all their workes, which the <hi>Turba</hi> nevertheleſſe ſets before their Eyes.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. But now thoſe ſoules which are damned in a high degree, are very preſumptuouſly bold, they reject God, and curſe him, and are his<note n="h" place="margin">Moſt malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oius.</note> worſt Enemies.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. They hold their cauſe to be juſt, they oppoſe God with da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring impudency, and thinke, is there fire? ſo are wee fire; is there<note n="i" place="margin">Riſing, boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties.</note> ſource? then wee will climbe up above God, and Heaven in the ſource of the fire: what care wee for humility, wee will have the ſtrength and might of the fire, we will be above God and doe Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by our Power.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Wee have the Roote, God hath but the Glance, let us be Lords, God ſhall be ſervant, our<note n="k" place="margin">The wrath of the Eternall Nature.</note> Mother is his life, wee will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his ſtrong Tower at once.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. They have the minde of Souldiers, that ſcale Forts and walls, and thinke the Citie is theirs, though indeed they looſe their lives and never get it.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. You muſt underſtand, that Hell is againſt Heaven, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof againſt the Inhabitants of Heaven; and this in God is alſo a great Wonder, all maketh for his Glory.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>The three and twentieth Queſtion.</hi> Whether doe the Soules of the wicked, without difference, (for ſo long a time before the Day of Judgement) feele any eaſe, or Refreſhment?</head>
                  <p n="1">1. A Thing whîch goeth into an Eternall Entrance, is alſo in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall End; who can put any thing into his hand that is a far off, and not preſent where it is to be done? he muſt give it onely into his hand that is by, to receive it: And that thing, which with its will is gone forth out of it ſelfe, can receive nothing within it ſelfe, becauſe it deſireth nothing within it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thus it is with the wicked, in this world: he is gone with his will out of himſelfe into Covetouſneſſe, Pride and pleaſure, into vices, gormandizing, tipling and whoring, alſo into Gluttony: his will is continually bent to diſpiſe the poore; in ſcorne and diſgrace to plague the poore, and to tread him downe by Authority.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He hath corrupted Judgement with lies and bribes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſwallowed downe unrighteouſneſſe as a Cow drinketh water; all that hath come from him hath been<note n="l" place="margin">Or <hi>cruell.</hi>
                     </note> bitter Anger, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted as farre as his power would reach: his will hath been meere wilfulneſſe, he hath done what he liſted; he hath danced after the Devills owne Pipe, and hath wholly entred into Covetouſneſſe; he hath accounted his money and meanes, his Treaſure; and his will hath continually entred into it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hath never retired into himſelfe, and ſought after Love, much leſſe humility; he hath eſteemed the needy, as his footſtoole, he hath cruſhed him under without meaſure: he hath counted it his Art and wit, when he hath been able thus to gripe and over-reach the ſimple; and deprive him of his labour.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He hath ſuppoſed, that he had found out the fineſt policy, who<note n="m" place="margin">Had gotten an Office.</note> could contrive his buſineſſe ſo ſure, that he might doe what he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, then he thought himſelfe very cunning, and that he had great Wiſdome.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. All this, yea, and much more he hath conceived in his will, and therewith the Image of the Spirit of the ſoule hath been filled, and all this ſtandeth in his figure; and when ever the body<note n="n" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> returnes to Earth.</note> dieth, then the <hi>Turba</hi> layeth hold of this in the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:171923:61"/>7. And then if the Spirit would faine enter into it ſelfe, the <hi>Turba</hi> goeth with it, and ſeeketh the ground, <hi>viz.</hi> the Roote of the ſoule, and ſo the fire is but<note n="o" place="margin">Inflamed.</note> kindled by it.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And you muſt know, that the ſoules of the wicked have no eaſe, their beſt eaſe and joy is when they climbe up in the will, in their<note n="p" place="margin">Employment, <hi>or</hi> Office.</note> workes which they did here, and continually deſire to doe them more ſtill: it grieveth them that they did not afflict the honeſt more then they did; their will is juſt ſo as it was here.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. They are Spirits of Pride, like the Devill, a Covetous devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Spirit, which devoureth their abominations which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted here: their joy is onely to thinke how they will contemne God, and be their owne Lords, this is their recreation and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and no other.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For, how ſhould they receive any other refreſhing? when they dare not for ſhame lift up their eyes to God, nor dare they flie to the Saints, whom they have here ſcorned; they are aſhamed to doe that, for their falſhood continually ſmiteth them on the face, and their malice and falſhood boyleth up from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. When but the leaſt thought of the laſt Day, commeth into their mindes, then feare and horrour ſtirreth in them: they rather let that thought alone, and recreate themſelves in haughtineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And this is alſo a Wonder, and the greateſt Wonder of All, that an<note n="q" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> an Image of Love.</note> Angell ſhould become ſuch a furious<note n="r" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> mad ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Image of Anger, and wrath.</note> Devill: and ſo the Power of Gods Anger commeth to be manifeſt in God: for God hath manifeſted himſelfe according to both<note n="ſ" place="margin">The Eye of Love, and the Eye of wrath.</note> Eyes, in Love and Anger: and it is left free to Man, he may goe into which of them he will: God throweth none into wrath, the ſoule caſteth it ſelfe into it.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But you muſt know, that the wrath hath ſet its<note n="t" place="margin">Or <hi>Jawes.</hi>
                     </note> throat wide open, and draweth mightily, and deſireth to devoure All; for it is the Covetouſneſſe, and the Pride inſulting over humility.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And ſo alſo Love and Humility have opened their Mouth; and draw with all their Powers, and would draw Man into Love, into Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Now into which of theſe the ſoule entreth, in that it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and groweth, whether in Love or in Anger; In that Tree it ſtandeth, and there is no Deliverance in Eternity from thence: here in this Life the ſoule ſtands in a Balance in the Angle, and may (though it have been evill) be borne againe in Love; but when the Angle breaketh then it is gone: it is afterwards in its owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in its Principle.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Who ſhall breake that which is Eternall, where no breaker can be found? for it is its own Maker; whence then ſhall another <hi>Turba</hi> come, when a thing is in the Eternity where no Limit is.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. But that you may ſee for all this, that God willeth not evill: He
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:171923:62"/> maketh his will knowne unto you; He ſendeth you Prophets and teachers, and giveth them his Spirit, that they may give you war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Now if you refuſe to obey; then you ſtay ſtill willingly in the Anger, which is your<note n="u" place="margin">Dwelling, <hi>or</hi> Priſon.</note> wages and Kingdome.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. God<note n="x" place="margin">Sends you Croſſes.</note> afflicteth you, to breake you off from your owne will, from your voluptuous proud, and diſſolute Life! But if you goe on, you ſhall hereafter ſurely taſte the helliſh Dregs.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Wee teach you the Croſſe: and the Devill teacheth you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Now you may take which you will, you ſhall have it, be it Love, or wrath.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. We labour for you, but you contemne us: what ſhould wee doe more for you; we are even your very ſlaves; if you will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept us, be it at your perill, and get you gone with that which is your owne, and we will take that which is ours, and ſo wee are parted for ever.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Wee will nevertheleſſe worke in our Day-labour, and doe what is commanded us: at the Harveſt we ſhall appeare before one another, and then you will know us, and doe that to your ſelves there, which you have here done to us: we will not hide this from you, but tell you what we ſee.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 49.8.14.</note>2. The Prayer and wiſh of the Righteous pierceth into Heaven, and not into Hell: the Scripture alſo telleth you, out of Hell there is no<note n="a" place="margin">Or <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
                     </note> Redemption; they lye in Hell as dead bones, they call, and no man heareth them; no praying availeth them.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. No good wiſh entreth into Hell: But if the wicked leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him much falſhood and deceit, ſo that the Helliſh Torment is wiſhed to him in the Grave, ſuch wiſhes come to the wicked ſoule, thoſe wiſhes come to paſſe with them; for that ſoule muſt ſwallow downe its abominations which it committed here: and that is its foode which the living ſend after it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But it is altogether unfit, and doth not become the Children of God at all: for thereby they ſow into Hell, into the Anger of God: they had need beware leaſt they alſo reape that which they ſow; moſt certainely, if they doe not recall themſelves and repent, it will fall out no otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Furthermore, wee give you to underſtand according to our knowledge in the Spirit (not according to the weening and conceit of the outward Man, but according to our Gift, that thoſe ſoules (which as it were hang by a<note n="b" place="margin">The threed of Faith, which is ſmall and weake.</note> threed, and but at laſt enter into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſo comprehend the Kingdome of Heaven as it were by a threed, ſo that doubting and Faith are mixt) are in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that a hearty Prayer and wiſh redoundeth to their profit, and pierceth into the poore captive ſoule, into its<note n="c" place="margin">Condition, <hi>or</hi> property, <hi>or</hi> miſerie.</note> ſource, if it be made with all Earneſtneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For, it is neither in Hell, nor in Heaven; but in the Gate, in the middle ſource of the Principle, where fire and Light ſever them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and is held by its <hi>Turba,</hi> that alwayes ſeeketh<note n="d" place="margin">

                  <p n="11">11. We ſay, that a mans hearty fervent prayer ſtands ſuch a one in ſtead; for, a zealous, earneſt, faithfull Prayer hath power to break open the Gates of the Deep, it breaketh open a whole Principle, and ſeeketh; and if there be any thing there, that is capable of its will, that taketh hold of it; <hi>viz.</hi> the poore ſoule in its ſource of ſinne eceiveth the earneſt, Divine will of its loving Brother, and ſo is

But in its glorification it cannot availe it; for, it ſhineth forth out of its owne Eſſence and will: The ſoule of a Neighbour goeth no further then death with it: (yet it is not the [neighbours] ſoule but the Spirit and will of his ſoule that doth ſo) and there the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger parteth, and then it is releaſed from the wrath; and then the Spirit entreth againe into its owne ſoule.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. In Popery much jugling hath been invented about this, in ſaying Maſſe for a ſoule, and that for money onely: but this hath been a great cheat of the Pope of <hi>Babell;</hi> for there is earneſtneſſe required, to wreſtle with the Anger of God, and overcome it.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Yet we confeſſe, and acknowledge readily that the Church of Chriſt hath great power to ranſome ſuch a ſoule; if with fervency and Earneſtneſſe it doe it: as it was done in the Primitive Church, when they had holy people, and Holy Prieſts, who performed their Miniſtry in reall Earneſtneſſe.</p>

                     <hi>The five and twentieth Queſtion.</hi> What is the Hand of God, and the Boſome of <hi>Abraham?</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. IT hath been ſufficiently cleared already, that it is the Eſſentiall Omnipreſence of God; but in its owne Principle: as the Rich man who was in Hell, could not obtaine that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould ſend <hi>Lazarus</hi> to him, with one drop of cold water to coole his tongue in thoſe flames: <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, there was a great Gulfe between them; that is, a whole Principle.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the boſome of <hi>Abraham</hi> is to be underſtood thus: <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was the Father of all the Faithfull; and God gave him the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that in his ſeed all people ſhould be bleſſed; this was to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Meſſia Chtiſt, who would become man in the<note n="y" place="margin">Or <hi>Beleevers.</hi>
                     </note> Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and as he became man in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, ſo alſo he would be borne anew in the Children of the faithfull, and bleſſe them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now this is the Holy Chriſtian Church, borne in Chriſt; and that is the boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for we are All one Body in Chriſt; and the Promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham:</hi> He is the Patriarch, we are all borne in the ſame Promiſe, (we meane [by] the New Birth in Chriſt) and are in the ſame boſome, which receiveth us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And when by earneſt Repentance, we enter into the Promiſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:171923:64"/> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then we goe into the boſome of <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="margin">Into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that is made to us by the Trinity.</note> into our Promiſe: and Chriſt is borne in us, in the boſome of Faith; this is the fulfillîng [of the Promiſe.]</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And thus; in Humility; we are with <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the boſome of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for Chriſt is <hi>Abraham:</hi> Chriſt was promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and now he hath him, and wee alſo: and ſo we come into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, and are his Children in the Promiſe, and Chriſt is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of it, and we in the fulfilling are in the boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by Faith and Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Heare O ye blinde <hi>Jewes,</hi> open your Eyes: what was meant by <hi>Abrahams</hi> Circumciſion, nothing elſe, but that ſinne ſhould be drowned in the bloud and death of Chriſt, who ſhed his bloud for the Children of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo [we] be regenerated in this bloud, as in a heavenly Tincture.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Children drowned ſinne in their bloud by Faith in Chriſt, who ſhould become Man in their bloud; and now it is fulfilled: and therefore God hath ſet the ſeale of Faith<note n="a" place="margin">That is in the Eſſence, <hi>or</hi> in the water.</note> in the ſubſtance; and now we muſt be, and are Regenerated in the true bloud of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The bloud of Chriſt, taketh away the <hi>Turba</hi> wholly from us: and ſo we, (<hi>viz.</hi> the New Man out of the Old <hi>Adam</hi>)<note n="b" place="margin">Or <hi>ariſe.</hi>
                     </note> ſtand up in Chriſts bloud, and beare Chriſts Image, Chriſts fleſh and bloud in us, in our Image; if we be Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not <hi>Iſmaels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. For, to <hi>Iſaack</hi> belong the Goods of the Image, of the body of Chriſt: the Circumciſion is <hi>Iſmaels,</hi> for he is converſant about workes; but the Goods are <hi>Iſaacks:</hi> yet <hi>Iſmaell</hi> ſhall dwell in <hi>Iſaacks</hi> Tents at laſt: for <hi>Japhet</hi> ſhall dwell in the Tents of <hi>Sem,</hi> but the Kingdome belongeth to <hi>Sem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. We have the goods of <hi>Iſaack</hi> not by the merit of workes, but from Grace, from the Love of God: wee cannot attaine them by workes; but in Faith, in the Will, in the Deed, and in entring [into the promiſed Inheritance.]</p>
                  <p n="11">11. He that entreth into an Inheritance, that is not his owne by right of Nature, he entreth into it by the favour of the<note n="c" place="margin">Or <hi>Giver.</hi>
                     </note> Donor: why is a ſervant in the houſe angry, that his Lord is ſo bountifull to give a ſtranger the Dominion.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Wee were ſtrangers, and muſt worke in his houſe; yet the Lord did promiſe us in Paradiſe, that he would againe freely out of Grace, give us his Kingdome: He rejected <hi>Caines</hi> offering, but he gave the Kingdome of grace to <hi>Abell;</hi> for <hi>Abell</hi> ſought it in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and <hi>Caine</hi> in the worke.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Thus you underſtand, that Gods Kingdome is Magicall; for, the earneſt will attaineth it, and not the Will in the<note n="d" place="margin">Or <hi>worke.</hi>
                     </note> Eſſence, for that will remaineth in the Eſſence, but he that is at liberty, he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:171923:64"/> Eternity and the Kingdome of Grace therein, and the Promiſe alſo, together with the Eſſence, and ſo the worke dwelleth in the Will, and is the wills houſhold ſervant.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Thus you underſtand (if you have your ſight) all the Old Teſtament; this is the onely ground; though compriſed but in brief: If we write upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> you ſhall finde it wholly there: and thus we have ſhewen you the true ground of the boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the true Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. He that teacheth otherwiſe is of <hi>Babell;</hi> beware of him, he hath not Chriſts Spirit: but he is <hi>Iſmaell;</hi> and ſeeketh but in his owne conceit.</p>

                     <hi>The ſix and twentieth Queſtion.</hi> Whether doe the Soules of the Dead take care about Men, Children, friends, and goods? And whether doe they know, ſee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or diſallow their purpoſes, and endeavours.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. MY beloved friend: this Queſtion is beyond the reach of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon, and knowledge according to outward Reaſon; But ſeeing we are <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children, we have alſo <hi>Abrahams</hi> Spirit in Chriſt: and as <hi>Abraham</hi> looked back upon the Promiſe in Paradiſe, and then alſo forward unto the fulfilling of the Promiſe, ſo that he ſaw in the whole Body of Chriſt, what was yet to be brought to paſſe in the<note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> the time between both the beginning and the End.</note> middle: and ſaw Chriſt a farre off; ſo alſo we.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now ſeeing you doe ſo vehemently long after the great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſeeke them with ſo earneſt a Deſire, yet giving God the glory accounting your ſelfe unworthy in your high Art, and ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelfe before God: therefore God giveth you them, by ſo meane and poore an Inſtrument, who eſteemeth himſelfe much more unworthy of them; but yet would not willingly ſtrive againſt his will: and ſo you are the cauſe that this hand findeth and attaineth them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For, this hand knew nothing of the Myſterie: It ſought onely
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:171923:65"/> for the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but the underſtanding of <hi>Abraham</hi> was alſo given unto it, which you have cauſed by your ſeeking.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now have a care, that you alſo obtaine the Spirit of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which hath written in the knowledge of this hand, wee will impart it to you as a brother: for wee are not your Lord in this hidden thing, but your ſervant.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Know us aright, we are <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and you may be accounted <hi>Abraham</hi> in compariſon of us; you have laboured much more then we; but we are fallen into your Harveſt: nor of merit, but by the Grace of the Giver: leaſt any tongue ſhould boaſt in the ſight of God, and ſay, this hath my underſtanding done.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. You propound a deep Queſtion,<note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Viz.</hi> in his outward Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>or</hi> in the Old <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </note> I underſtand it not: for if I ſhould underſtand it, then I ſhould dwell in the ſeparated ſoule, and muſt have the very ſame ſpirit, and knowledge of that ſoule.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But now ſeeing we are one body in Chriſt, we have all of us Chriſts Spirit; therefore in Chriſt we all ſee out of one Spirit, and have one knowledge; for he is become man in us, and all holy ſoules are our fellow-members, all begotten out of one: and we all have one will in Chriſt, in the true boſome of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. And now we have obtained ſtrength to reveale this hidden thing to you in Chriſt; for our ſoules ſeeth in their ſoule; not as if they came to us, but we goe to them: for they are in perfection, and we but<note n="g" place="margin">In part, <hi>or</hi> in imperfection.</note> in part.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And now we are able to anſwer you, not from the reaſon of the outward world; but from the Image in Chriſt, and from his and our Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. You aske, whether the ſeparated ſoules take care of humane matters, and allow, or diſallow them? Now this you muſt underſtand to be in three different manners, concerning three ſeverall ſorts of ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Firſt, thoſe ſoules, which yet have not attained Heaven, and ſo ſtick in the ſource, in the Principle, in the Birth, thoſe have yet the humane Eſſence with the workes in them: they diligently ſearch out the cauſe of their<note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> ſtay in that condition.</note> Retention.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And therefore many of them come againe with the Aſtrall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and wander up and downe in their houſes and places of abode, and appeare in a humane Shape, and deſire this and that, and oftentimes take care about their wills or Teſtaments, and alſo thinke to procure the bleſſing of the Saints, that they may reſt: and if their Earthly affaires doe ſtill ſtick in them, they take care many times alſo about their Children and friends.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. This condition of theirs continueth ſo long, till they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Reſt; and till their Aſtrall Spirit be conſumed; then all ſuch doings, care, and perplexities are at an end, and rhey alſo have
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:171923:65"/> no more knowledge thereof, but that they ſee them meerely in the Wonders, in the Magick.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But it ſtirreth not the <hi>Turba,</hi> neither ſeeketh what is in this world: for, it being once paſſed through Death from the <hi>Turba,</hi> it deſireth ſuch things no more; It alſo taketh no further care: for care ſtirreth up the <hi>Turba,</hi> and then the will of the Soule ſhould be forced to enter with its Spirit into earthly things; but it had rather let ſuch things alone, becauſe it hardly got rid of them before; It will no more entertaine the Earthly will.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. This is an Anſwer concerning this firſt ſort, and wee tell you plainely, and in Truth; that this ſort (after they are once received into Grace) take no more care purpoſely about humane Earthly<note n="i" place="margin">Or <hi>affaires.</hi>
                     </note> matters: but it beholdeth the heavenly matters, which are brought to it by the Spirit of man, and rejoyceth in them; but there is ſomewhat ſtill behinde, which is this.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. A living man hath ſuch Power, that he is able with his Spirit, to goe into Heaven to the ſeparated ſoules, and ſtirre them up about ſome Queſtion by a hearty Deſire: but it muſt be earneſt, it muſt be Faith, that can breake open a Principle.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And this we ſee in <hi>Samuell</hi> the Prophet, whom the<note n="k" place="margin">Saul.</note> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> raiſed up: that he might make his will knowne to him: though this ſeeme otherwiſe to ſome: of whom we may well ſay, that they are blinde and voyde of knowledge, for they ſpeake but their owne ſcholaſtick Fables, and frame Opinions about that they have no knowledge of in the Spirit: and theſe are <hi>Babell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. Now ſecondly, the other ſort, which ſinke into Death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a<note n="l" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> the body of Chriſt.</note> body, they are wholly in one, and the ſame place of the Principle, in which the firſt ſort are, which afterward did ſinke downe in themſelves: All theſe take no evill affaires upon them, wherein the <hi>Turba</hi> ſticketh.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But when the honeſt ſoules which are alive, ſend them their workes, with their Spirit and will, they rejoyce in them, and are ſo affable, that they appeare to men Magically in ſleepe, and ſhew them good wayes, and many times reveale Arts which lye in<note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>In Arcano,</hi> in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> ſecret, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Abyſſe of the ſoule.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. For, ſeeing the Earthly Spirit thruſteth its Myſterie before the ſoule, and keepeth the ſoule captive in that Myſterie, therefore the Spirit of the Soule cannot alwayes attaine the deepeſt ſecrets; but after the departure of the body, the ſoule is naked, and that eſpecially, if it be without a New body; then it beholdeth it it ſelfe, and alſo its Wonders: and it can very well ſhew one that is living ſomewhat (if he be honeſt and have not ſtirred up the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>) in the ſleeping <hi>Magia:</hi> for Dreames are wholly Magicall, and the ſoule without a Body is in the <hi>Magia</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p n="21">
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:171923:66"/>21. Thus know that no ſoule ſeparated from the body entreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any wicked matter, except it be a damned ſoule, which indeed entreth in Magically, and hath its joy therein, and teacheth moſt notorious vile prancks in Dreames, for it is a ſervant of the Devill.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. And whatſoever a wicked man deſireth, that the Devill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily helpeth him to; for he can doe it better by the ſoule of a man then of himſelfe, for he is too crude, and<note n="n" place="margin">Makes hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the <hi>Magia.</hi>
                     </note> terrifieth the <hi>Magia,</hi> ſo that the Elementary Spirit is aſtoniſhed, and<note n="o" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> raiſeth up.</note> awakeneth the body.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Alſo you muſt know this, that all is done Magically in the will, without<note n="p" place="margin">Raiſing of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

                  <p n="24">24. There are many villanies in Nigromancy, which can many times vex and torment the Spirits of men; but it can doe ſo to no ſoule, that is cloathed with Chriſts Eſſentiality; for, that ſoule is free.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. The third ſort of ſeparated ſoules, which are in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, in Chriſt, having the heavenly Eſſentiality, none can ſtirre them, except they will themſelves, as when they beare a favour to a ſoule that is like themſelves: alſo they take no Earthly thing upon them, except it maketh for the Glory of God, and then they are reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to reveale ſomething in a Magicall manner.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. But they let no <hi>Turba</hi> into them; neither doe they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with God for us; but whatſoever commeth to them they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it, with the Angels: for, the Angels rejoyce at a ſinner that repenteth; then much more, the ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Why ſhould they pray to God for us? it lyeth not in their Prayer; but in mans entring into God; when he ſtrongly turneth his will to God, then Gods Spitit helpeth him without<note n="q" place="margin">Their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>or</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us.</note> Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. For, his Armes are ſtretched forth day and night to help Man; what need is there then of their Prayers? It is the will of God that man ſhould come to him.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Shall then a<note n="r" place="margin">A ſeparated ſoule of a Saint.</note> ſoule be ſo preſumptuous as to make God ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a Judge, as not to be willing to receive a returning ſinner? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no true knowledge of God were in this: But when they ſee the ſoule pierce in with its Spirit to God; it is great joy to them that Gods Kingdome is enlarged.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. The heavenly ſoule hath Gods will: what God willeth, that it willeth alſo; but it is Gods Spirit it ſelfe that will help the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſinner.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. The ſoules ſee well how Gods Spirit pierceth into the ſoule, if the will of the ſoule doe but give way to it: there is no neede of the Prayers of any<note n="ſ" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> bleſſed ſoule.</note> Angell: they all wiſh that Gods Kingdome may
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:171923:66"/> come, and that Gods will be done: but the Honour of Government they give to God.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. That men in Popery have invocated great Saints that are dead: and that they alſo have appeared to men, and wrought<note n="t" place="margin">Or <hi>Miracles.</hi>
                     </note> Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, we acknowledge it, and it is true: and although it be now taught againſt, it is by thoſe that are indeed quite ignorant in it: It hath another A. B. C. which all of them on both ſides doe not underſtand at all.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. The Faith of one receiveth the Faith of another, the Faith of the living tooke hold of the Faith of the Saints departed, and the<note n="u" place="margin">
                        <hi>Viz.</hi> the will that is ſtrong.</note> Faith hath wrought Wonders.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Yea it is ſo powerfull, that it can throw downe Mountaines! ſhall then the pure Faith of the Saints in the Faith of the living be able to doe nothing? Indeed it could even<note n="x" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> breake in peeces.</note> deſtroy the whole world, if God would but ſuffer it.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. As he hath permitted it to worke ſo farre ſometimes, that the Heathen have been converted by ſuch meanes, when they have ſeene ſuch Wonders wrought at the<note n="y" place="margin">Or <hi>depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                     </note> Death of Saints.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Should not a ſoule in heaven be willing to put forth its Faith for the glory of God, and the working of wonders for him? This is even done by the Holy Ghoſt, who hath wrought the Wonders by the Faith of both parties; and they are onely the Wonders of God, and of his Children-</p>

                     </note> Wonders: but it is <hi>Babell,</hi> and not the Spirit of God; It is envious Pride; They ſtand aloft and cry; Come ye all to me, here is Chriſt, here is the Goſpel: Indeed there is Pride, Covetouſneſſe, Ambition, and ſelfe, arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting malepertneſſe, a lifting up of proud <hi>Babell.</hi>

                  <p n="38">38. It is even the old Antichriſt, and they are young twigs ſprung out of the old Tree, and they have ſtirred up the <hi>Turba</hi> with their ſtrong wrathfull ſap: which <hi>Turba</hi> ſhall roote up the whole Tree, for God hath curſed it: it is wholly evill, and wormeaten, it ſhall downe.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. For, there is a young Tree growne out of the Roote, out of the old Root, which ſhall diſcover what the old Tree hath been in its Wonders.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. Yet we would not upbraid any, but onely ſpeake of our Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: and ſay that the ſervant ſhall enter into the Houſe, and be free, for the time is at hand, that he ſhould eat with the Sonne, and be merry and rejoyce with him.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. Thus we anſwer this your Queſtion ſummarily, that indeed, the Holy ſoules doe certainly know of our holy workes, and approve
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:171923:67"/> of them, but they doe not at all regard falſe workes: for, they dwell in another Principle, into which no evill worke can come, nay, they doe not ſo, nor doe they enquire after that which belongeth to the Devill: alſo they know nothing but that which reacheth to their Principle.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. Children, Parents, friends, and ſtrangers are all alike to them; for, in Heaven we are all Brethren: They take no greater care of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or Children then they doe of others, unleſſe they ſerve God, and then their ſervice of God is acceptable and joyfull to them; but they enter not into their<note n="a" place="margin">The evill which they doe <hi>or</hi> ſuffer juſtly.</note>

                  <p n="43">43. For after the laſt Day, honeſt Parents ſhall know nothing of their Children which are in Hell: Therefore it is ſufficiently and plainely knowne to us, that they now alſo take no care about wicked matters.</p>

Neither ſhould any vnderſtand this our manner of writing ſo, as if the hand did glory, or boaſt it ſelfe of its humane Authority, and worthineſſe; though indeed we are worthy in Chriſt: but as to the outward Man we will have no honour or Renowne, for the Renowne is Gods.</p>

                  <p n="18">18. For, the Reſervatories will be divers, not onely two, <hi>viz.</hi> the two Principles; yet in two Principles; but with much difference: every thing according to its<note n="h" place="margin">Or <hi>power.</hi>

                  <p n="36">36. They ſhall then ſtand in great horrour and trembling, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and crying to the Judge Chriſt: but his wrathfull Eye<note n="x" place="margin">Or <hi>by.</hi>

                  <p n="41">41. For, the Starres are a Magicall<note n="d" place="margin">Deſire, <hi>or</hi> longing.</note> ſeeking, which hath awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Life: therefore now when the Earth is awakened in the great <hi>Turba,</hi> it will then become ſo thirſty and hungry, that it will draw downe the Starres to it, there will be ſuch an Anguiſh upon the Earth.</p>

                  <p n="44">44.

                  </p>
                  <p n="45">45. And then the voyce of the Holy Ternarie, will put forth it ſelfe according to all the three Principles, and ſay by the Mouth of Chriſt the Judge: Ariſe ye Dead and come to Judgement.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. This voyce is the originall, Eternall Spirit, which upholdeth every life, and which alſo hath alwayes governed in all the three Principles: for, it is that Spirit, whence the life of every thing hath
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:171923:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſprung, and in which it conſiſteth to Eternity; It hath been the lif and motion of all things, in which the beginning, and alſo the end of every life hath ſtood, yes, even the Eternity it ſelfe: for, it is from Eternity and the Creatour of all things.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. It hath two Eternall beginnings, <hi>viz.</hi> one in the Fire, and one in the Light: and the third beginning is become the<note n="f" place="margin">Wherein the Eternall hath been beheld.</note> Glaſſe of the Eternall, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of this world; alſo it hath been as a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in this world, and the Wonders have been made manifeſt by it: and it is he to whom the laſt Judgement doth belong, his moving is the laſt.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. For, in the Creation he moved the Father; and in the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Word, the Sonne, and now the laſt moving, and the Judgement is his: he will reduce every thing to its Eternall abode; and this is done by the voyce of the word proceeding from the Mouth of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. For, the Spirit goeth forth in two Principles in God: that is, in the Anger or Fire, he goeth forth as the earneſt wrath of the Fire-life; in the light of the Love he goeth forth as a flame of the Divine Majeſtie; and in the Spirit of this world he goeth forth as a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Life; and all this is undeniable.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. And if perhaps ſome perſon would arrogate ſuch exceeding high Learning to himſelfe, as to gaineſay it, to him we offer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate it, in every thing, we will except nothing in this world: every thing will afford an evident Teſtimony of it: let him come to us when he will: he ought not to put it off, and ſay, we are mad: for if theſe few words will not ſatisfie him, we will ſo evidence it to him, that he himſelfe ſhall finde and ſee who himſelfe is: yes though the Devill himſelfe ſhould burſt for very Anger, yet we would ſet it downe plainely before his eyes.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. Now ſeeing this Spirit hath the word <hi>Fiat, (viz.</hi> Gods word,) and the Center of Nature, whence it hath its Eternall Originall; and as the Spirit of the Center hath a twofold Effluence (the firſt being in the Fire, in the Eſſences of the Originall of Life, in the ground of the Origînall of the ſoule: and the ſecond in the light of the Fire, which is the ſecond<note n="g" place="margin">Or <hi>Property.</hi>
                     </note> ſource, which buddeth afreſh through Death, and is called the Kingdome of God; where alſo in the Light it is a flame of Love, and in the Fire it is a flame of Anger.)</p>
                  <p n="52">52. And therefore it will breake open the Gates of Death, for it ſhall raiſe the Dead: and it hath the word <hi>Fiat</hi> in it, and this <hi>Fiat</hi> is both in the ſoule, and in the body alſo; and although the body have been long corrupted, yet the <hi>Turba</hi> remaineth ſtill in the <hi>Fiat</hi> with the Wonders of the body.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. And now the foure Elements muſt reſtore to the <hi>Fiat</hi> that Eſſence which they have ſwallowed up: for<note n="h" place="margin">Verbum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</note> the word of the Lord
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:171923:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> is in it, but in its owne Principle: Every thing muſt<note n="i" place="margin">Give, <hi>or</hi> yield up.</note> reſtore that which it hath received, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earth, the body <hi>viz.</hi> the<note n="k" place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>or</hi> droſſe.</note> 
                     <hi>Phur'</hi> and the water alſo its Eſſence, that is,<note n="l" place="margin">The Light.</note> 
                     <hi>Sul;</hi> The Aire, the ſound, and voyce of the words: and the Fire, the Eſſences of the ſoule, for All things muſt be judged.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. All the words which the Mouth hath ſpoken, which the Aire hath received into it, and<note n="m" place="margin">Which Aire.</note> hath ſerved for the making of the words, theſe the Aire ſhall againe<note n="n" place="margin">Or <hi>repreſent.</hi>
                     </note> bring forth: for it is the Glaſſe of the Eternall Spirit: the Spirit ſeeth them in the Glaſſe.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. And ſo man ſhall be Judged according to his heart, minde, and thoughts; for, the <hi>Turba</hi> is in all malice or wickedneſſe; which is contrary to Love: here will be no making of excuſe; for every one will accuſe himſelfe, his owne <hi>Turba</hi> will accuſe him.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. And thus, (you muſt underſtand) the Spirit which is All in All, will raiſe up every Life which hath been immortall, and (by the <hi>Fiat</hi>) give it to the body; for the <hi>Fiat</hi> draweth the body to the ſoule: and all its deeds and Wonders with it, yea, all that it hath done in this life by word or Deed: all that hath reached the<note n="o" place="margin">The moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt ground.</note> Abyſſe of the ſoule, muſt come forth.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. For, in the ſtill Eternity there ſhall be no <hi>Turba</hi> more; and therefore Every Eſſence ſhall be<note n="p" place="margin">Tried, waſhed, cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>or</hi> purged.</note> refined by the Fire, and the<note n="q" place="margin">Sinne and wickedneſſe.</note> 
                     <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> ſhall remaine in the Fire, and all whatever is evill and capable of the <hi>Turba</hi> (unleſſe it were waſhed away in the water of life, by the converſion of the ſoule here in this life,) muſt remaine in the Fire.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. Now, if any man have ſowne much in the Fire, he ſhall ſuffer loſſe: as the Scripture telleth us, that the workes of the wicked ſhall remaine in the fire, and he ſhall ſuffer loſſe.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. But you muſt underſtand us aright; the body which hath been here upon Earth; that evill corruptible body which hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Noble and excellent Image of Paradiſe: ſhall come, and ſtand forth with its precious Image in it: It muſt give an account of the Image of God.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. Now bleſſed are they that have Chriſts Spirit, they have their firſt Image in the word <hi>Fiat;</hi> which muſt reſtore it againe to the ſoule, and that in the Adamicall Body.</p>
                  <p n="61">61. But they that have not Chriſts Spirit ſhall ſtand forth in the evill body: but their ſoule ſhall have loſt their true Image, and they ſhall have ſuch an Image in the Spirit of the Soule, as their wills have been here: as their daily luſt hath been, ſo ſhall their Image be.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. And in that houre alſo the wrathfull <hi>Fiat</hi> of the Darkneſſe ſhall bring forth the Devills; who ſhall then receive their wages and lodging: at the hearing of which they tremble.</p>
                  <p n="63">63. Thus all the Dead, both good and evill ſhall ariſe, every one in his<note n="r" place="margin">The tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall body.</note> twofold body, and ſhall have the ſoule with the Spirit in the body.</p>

                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:171923:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>64. One ſhall have the outward Earthly<note n="ſ" place="margin">Life in foure Copies; it may be body, by the ſenſe.</note> Life, and therein a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall Image in the Spirit of the Soule; and in the Inward Image he ſhall have the Eſſentiality of the wrathfull Anger.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. Another ſhall have the outward body, and Chriſts Image therein, and the Divine Spirit of Love ſhall ſhine in the Spirit of his ſoule; which body the word <hi>Fiat</hi> cloatheth againe with the true, and pure Adamicall Image.</p>
                  <p n="66">66. For, the pure Image hath been hidden in God, in the Word which became Man: and now when the Soule commeth to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, it obtaineth that againe, and alſo the faire and excellent<note n="t" place="margin">See the booke of the three Principles, <hi>ch. 12. ver. 53.</hi>

                  <p n="67">67. For, the noble Image was deſtroyed in <hi>Adam</hi> when the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was taken out of him, ſo that he retained onely the Tincture of the Fire; and the woman had the Tincture of the Spirit: but<note n="u" place="margin">In the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</note> now both returne to them wholly againe.</p>
                  <p n="68">68. For, the woman ſhall receive the Tincture of the Fire, in the Divine Fire, ſo that ſhe ſhall be as <hi>Adam</hi> was, neither Man nor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: but a Virgine full of Chaſtity, without the<note n="x" place="margin">Forme, <hi>or</hi> diſtinction.</note> ſhape or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Man or woman.</p>

And then they ſhall no more ſay, thou art my husband, or thou art my wife, but they are brethren: indeed there ſhall ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining tokens of the differences be in the Divine Magicall Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but none will regard that: for, they are all of them meerely the Children of God, living the life of Children in the delighting ſport of love.</p>
                  <p n="70">70. All this ſhall be done before the Sentence, for, the tryall will be the firſt, and the ſentence the laſt Day of Judgement: and thoſe that are then alive ſhall not dye; but ſhall be preſented with the other by the voyce of God before the<note n="y" place="margin">Or <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>

                  <p n="73">73. For the Judge will ſay unto them, now give an account of

                  <p n="1">1. HEre we muſt conſider Paradiſe; for, this outward world with its fruits and colours hath been a Figure of Paradiſe: for, Paradiſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:171923:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> was<note n="f" place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2. But we ſhall now enter into it againe, and Eternally ſolace our ſelves in the excellent beautifull flouriſhing of all manner of flowers, and Formes, both of Trees, and Plants, and all kinde of Fruites; but they will not be ſo Earthly groſſe and palpable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For, then our bodies ſhall not be ſo; how then can that Eſſence be ſo? all things there will be Angelicall: the Fruits are more<note n="g" place="margin">cleere, ſubtile, tranſparent, bright, and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> pure and fine, then are now in the outward Elements, for they make no impurity when we have eaten them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſhall have no ſtomack or intrailes, which we ſhall need to fill, as we doe here, this devouring ſtomack; but all there, is in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we ſhall eate in the Mouth and not receive into the body: we ſhall need no teeth to chew withall, there is meere Power; and yet in a true Naturall forme and manner with ſhining colours.</p>

                  <p n="13">13. And thus we tell you, we ſhall have a body conſiſting of Fleſh and bloud, ſuch a body as Chriſt had; for Chriſt by his Incarnation is<note n="e" place="margin">Or <hi>borne.</hi>

                  <p n="15">15. Chriſt becommeth borne in the converted ſinner, and he in Chriſt becommeth the Childe of God, this is the body wee ſhall have in Heaven.</p>

                  <p n="18">18. Here indeed we are as it were<note n="g" place="margin">

                  <p n="19">19. Therefore we ſay, that we ſhall have the Divine Body and Chriſts body which filleth Heaven: wee ſhall not remaine in that which is his Creature: but be joyned one to another as members, brethren and Children.</p>

But if God ſhall pleaſe to grant, that we may write ſomewhat upon the firſt, and alſo upon the ſecond Booke of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſomewhat more ſhould be revealed: for the Names of the Fathers before the Floud which are there ſet downe, belong all to the Myſterie, and they containe great Wonders in them: when it is Day, you ſhall clearely know the whole courſe of the world in it.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. If we would conſider the ſoule of Chriſt, we need onely ſeeke and finde our ſelves: for Chriſts ſoule is a humane ſoule, conceived in <hi>Mary</hi> the<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4. Yet we doe not acknowledge the outward mortall Life in <hi>Mary</hi> for a pure Virgine: for, that which is mortall hath the Anger and the <hi>Turba</hi> which corrupteth all Purity, ſo that no pure Virgine is borne of <hi>Eve,</hi> but are all daughters of her.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And <hi>Eve</hi> her ſelfe was but halfe a Virgine, for <hi>Adam</hi> was the other halfe, according to the two Tinctures, in which man ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be wholly a Virgine in pure Love, and ſo ſaw God through himſelfe, that is, through the Creature he ſaw the Originall, which produced thoſe two out of it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And thus alſo in one<note n="b" place="margin">The whole and not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perſon, as <hi>Adam</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſlept.</note> whole perſon, there is one pure Love and Chaſtity: for it ſeeketh no other Conjunction, it ſelfe is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of both Tinctures, <hi>viz.</hi> the Tincture of the ſoule, and the Tincture of the Spirit; and its power was ſuch that it could bring forth a Spirit out of the fiery Tincture, which is [ſaid to be] a ſoule and Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Which <hi>Adam</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Extinguiſhed, <hi>or</hi> put out.</note> loſt, when he ſuffered the Earthly Life to take him captive, and therefore he muſt be divided, and a woman be made out of him, which muſt ſet her Love,<note n="d" place="margin">Longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, <hi>or</hi> luſt.</note> Deſire, and Imagination up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Adamicall fiery Tincture: if ſhe would be pregnant with a Soule.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Thus none can ſay, that <hi>Eve</hi> was a pure and chaſte Virgine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the contaction of <hi>Adam:</hi> for as ſoone as <hi>Adam</hi> did awake from ſleepe, he ſaw her ſtanding by him, and did preſently ſet his<note n="e" place="margin">Fancie, <hi>or</hi> Deſire; <hi>or</hi> lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted after her.</note> Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon her, and tooke her to him and ſaide; this is fleſh of my fleſh, and bone of my bone: ſhe ſhall be called Woman, becauſe ſhe is taken from Man.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And ſhe <hi>(Eve)</hi> inſtantly ſet her Imagination upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo both were mutually kindled with the Deſire of each other.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Where is now the pure Chaſtity and Modeſty? is it not beſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? is not the outward Image become a Beaſt? as is to be ſeene plaine enough in his Will and<note n="f" place="margin">Or <hi>doings.</hi>

                  <p n="11">11. But that he might be reſtored, and the Image reduced into Unity, that word which ſpake the ſoule out of the Mouth of God, and did breath it from the Holy Ghoſt into the Image, is become Man, and is entred into the Earthly Image, that is, into the <hi>Turba</hi> of Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:171923:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>12. And you know very well, that the word hath the water of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Life, and the Fire, the Deity, and out of the Fire [it hath] the Tincture of the Deity, and in the Tincture, the Spirit of God, which proceedeth from the Mouth of God; and in the proceeding forth the<note n="g" place="margin">Or <hi>Luſter.</hi>
                     </note> glance of the Majeſty is made manifeſt in the operation of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. This word which is in the Virgine of the wiſdome of God, and encompaſſed with the Wonders of Eternity, is now in humility of great Love towards our Image which was loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> come againe into us, and is in Mary (underſtand the Earthly <hi>Mary,</hi> yet in the Benediction) become Man.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The Benediction was, that the ſoule of <hi>Mary</hi> was adorned with the heavenly Virgine of the wiſdome of God, which <hi>Adam</hi> had loſt; therefore the Angell called her bleſſed of all Women.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. No woman from <hi>Adam</hi> to that Time was ever cloathed with the heavenly Virgine but this <hi>Mary:</hi> therefore by the bleſſing ſhe became chaſte and full of Purity: for the Holy Ghoſt goeth not into that which is Earthly, he mixeth himſelfe not with the<note n="h" place="margin">Similitude, <hi>or</hi> Reſemblance.</note> Glaſſe, for it cannot be that the Glaſſe ſhould be as the Life it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Underſtand our high and precious depth thus; The ſoule of Man proceedeth from God, and is from the Eternall; and the body of man is but a Glaſſe of the Eternall, and ſo God cloathed the ſoule of <hi>Mary</hi> with the Divine Virgine, in the Principle of the ſoule; not in the Earthly fleſh; as if ſhe had been deified: no! ſhe muſt die <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> well as all other people.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And in this Virgine, Gods word, out of the Heart of God the Father aſſumed the ſeed of the Woman, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſeed of the ſoule, and the ſeed of the firſt Image, which for ſo long a time ſtood hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Myſtery.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. But now at length, the Life of God entred into it, and did make it a whole Image againe: for, the water of Eternall life proceeding from the Heart of God, mingled with the water of the Spirit of the ſoule: for the Spirit taketh its Originall from the water, and the ſoule is Fire.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Thus the word received the Tincture of the ſoule, and the Holy Ghoſt the Tincture of the Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> the Tincture of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and both became one ſoule: and yet the Creature was ſtill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from Gods Spirit, though Gods Spirit dwelt therein: and of Gods water and Tincture, and of the ſeed of <hi>Mary,</hi> from her Tincture and water, in the high benediction, a fleſh and bloud was produced, ſo that an Heavenly Man in the Earthly was incarnate at once.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. So that it may be ſaid; this is the Sonne of the Woman; <hi>viz.</hi> the very bodily and naturall Sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> with ſoule and body,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:171923:81"/> with fleſh and bloud, and all that belongeth unto Man: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the very Sonne of God, which was borne from Eternity out of Gods Eternall Eſſence, ere the foundation of the world was layd; who ſtood both in the Majeſty of the Holy Ternary, and alſo in the<note n="i" place="margin">Or <hi>wombe.</hi>
                     </note> body of <hi>Mary</hi> at once.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. And the ſoule of Chriſt doth belong halfe to the Principle of this world, and halfe to the Holy Ghoſt: for, the ſou e of Chriſt uſed the Spirit of the Aire and Starres, with the vertue of the Elements; and alſo the Word of God and the Divine food; for ſuch a man <hi>Adam</hi> was in his Innocency.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Thus God hath regenerated us in Chriſt; and ſo we are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in Chriſt out of Gods word and Spirit, by the water of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Life, and ſo we are Gods Children in Chriſt: and if we reſigne our ſelves up to Chriſt, departing from our Reaſon and will, then we put on Chriſts body, and our will and Spirit liveth from Chriſt, who is in us and we in him.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Hence you may underſtand what the Temptation of Chriſt was, <hi>viz.</hi> The Regenerate man was to endure <hi>Adams</hi> Temptation [to trie] whether his ſoule could ſtand ſtedfaſt in God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was proved in the <hi>Turba</hi> [to trie] whether he could ſtand ſtedfaſt in three Principles, and rule over the outward Life: and therefore foode was withdrawne from the outward Life, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward muſt over power the outward, and eate of the word of the Lord, and uphold the outward in its owne Power, and full Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and alſo keep Death captive, that it might not be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the outward Life: this muſt needs be a hard Combat!</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And the other two Temptations were theſe, viz. he was tempted [to trie] whether man would live in<note n="k" place="margin">Or <hi>compleat.</hi>
                     </note> full obedience, and ſuffer God to worke in him; or whether he would exalt himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and be free from God, as <hi>Lucife<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> did? therefore the Devill muſt tempt him, becauſe this man was to poſſeſſe his Royall Throne.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. Wee have ſpoken ſomewhat of it already: but becauſe this Queſtion doth put us in minde of it againe; mentioning that when he dyed, he commended it to his Father; therefore we muſt a little ſay how that was done.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. You ſufficiently perceive in what manner the ſoule is the<note n="x" place="margin">Centrum Naturae.</note> Center of Nature, the Originall of Life, and mobility, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods Fire: which ſhould be continually converted into the Eternall will of God, wherein it is originally borne from the Magicall Deſire, and is a great Secret come out of the Eternall Nothing, wherein all things are contained, even the Deity with all the three Principles, and every<note n="y" place="margin">Thing, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>or</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> Being that can be named.</p>

                     </note> ſource of the Fire it is its owne Life.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And further, wee have ſaid ſomewhat of the Noble Tincture which ariſeth in the Light, in which the meekneſſe of the Light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, and it commeth forth from the Anguiſh which is as a mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſpringeth forth afreſh through the mortifying Anguiſh, as a life having another<note n="a" place="margin">Or <hi>Source.</hi>

                  <p n="10">10. And therein are two Formes: One according to the ſource of Fire which is red, and therein the vertue, <hi>viz. Sulphur;</hi> And the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which is like a thin meekneſſe, yet having Eſſentiality,) is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: which the deſiring Tincture contracteth together into one, and changeth it into Bloud.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Now the Originall in the Bloud, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire (which is a warmth, that is, a Tincture) is a Life; and in the vertue of the Tincture, the thin water of the Life proceedeth, one<note n="b" place="margin">The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> vertue proceeding forth from<note n="c" place="margin">The inward.</note> another; and the vertue doth alwayes reaſſume that which goeth forth: and that which is gone forth is free from the Fire, and alſo from the vertue, for it is gone forth, and yet it aroſe from the vertue.</p>

                  <p n="14">14. But ſeeing this Spirit ariſeth firſt out of the Center of Nature, that is, out of the Life of Fire, (although it is not the life of the Fire, but the Spirit of it, and the Life of the Fire ſtandeth originally in the Abyſſe, în the ſource of Gods Anger) therefore Chriſt did not commend this Spirit of his to the fires owns life, but into the hands of his Father.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. His hands are the Love-Deſire, wherewith he embraceth our Spirit, when we enter into him, and commend our ſelves to him.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. For, when his body was to dye on the Croſſe; and his ſoule was to paſſe through Hell, through the Anger of God; there the Devills waited, and thought with themſelves, we will ſurely keep the ſoule in our <hi>Turba</hi> in the Fire; and then Chriſt commended the Spirit into the Love of God.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And ſo the ſoule of Chriſt with the Spirit came into Gods hand, being encompaſſed with the Fire of Anger and Death: and Death would have held it there, but Death was deſtroyed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. For, Death ſmothered the outward [Spirit] <hi>viz.</hi> the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Life, and then thought, now ſurely the ſoule muſt remaine in the <hi>Turba:</hi> but there was one, ſtronger in the ſoule; <hi>viz.</hi> the word of God: which tooke death captive, and deſtroyed the Anger, and quenched the wrath with the Love in the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. It was a poyſon to Hell, for the Love of God to come into it, and ſmother it in the ſoule alſo a Plague, Death and Deſtruction to Death; Death muſt now ſuffer an Eternall Life to grow in it.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Thus the Spirit of Chriſt tooke the Divell captive, and drave him out of the Fire of the ſoule, and caſt him into Darkneſſe: and ſhut him up under darkneſſe, out from the Fire of the ſoule, and out from Gods Fire; into the wrathfull harſhneſſe and bitterneſſe in cold: there let him warme himſelfe leaſt he freeze with cold.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Conſider the firſt foure Formes of Nature, and you will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what the Devills Manſion is: for, before Chriſt [came] he kept the ſoule captive in the <hi>Turba,</hi> with the Fire; and although he had not the Spirit of the ſoule, yet he had the root of it in the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba:</hi> but then he was commanded to ceaſe; and he was throwne out, and driven into Darkneſſe, and thus his malice was deſtroyed by
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:171923:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> Chriſts deſcending into Hell, and Chriſt became his Judge.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Thus we have in briefe deſcribed what the Spirit of Chriſt, and our Spirit is; <hi>viz.</hi> not the outward Spirit, but the Spirit of the ſoule; not the ſoule it ſelfe, but the Spirit of its Life.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. As, in God, the Holy Ternary, is diſtinct, being three Perſons in one Eſſence, and yet but one onely God; where the Sonne hath the Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> the Life, iſſuing forth from the Heart and mouth; and the Heart is the flame of Love; and the Father the<note n="e" place="margin">Fountaine, <hi>or</hi> Property.</note> ſource of Anger, which is made meeke, by the Sonne, in the Love, ſo that in God there is but one onely will and Eſſence.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Thus it is alſo in Man, and no otherwiſe, no not in the leaſt tittle: whatſoever God in Chriſt is, that wee alſo are in Chriſt, in God; his true Children: Therefore let us alſo commend our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into his hands, and ſo we may be able to paſſe through Death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Life, into God, with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="25">25.

                  <p n="3">3. For, all Prophets ſpeake from the <hi>Turba,</hi> they diſcover that which is falſe, and declare what is better, which entreth into the will of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Therefore, be pleaſed not to urge us with this Queſtion; for, we ſhall be captivated in the <hi>Turba</hi> by it: you may underſtand enough in all the Queſtions, what is to done hereafter, we have hinted it to you clearely enough.</p>

                     </note> compriſed the ſoule, by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall <hi>Fiat</hi> in the Eternall will of the Father, in the Center of the Eternall Nature: and opened it with the Holy Ghoſt, or blew it up like a fire (which lay hid in the Eternity, and wherein all formes of the eternall Nature ſtood from Eternity:) and<note n="r" place="margin">The ſoule, the formes.</note> is alone known in the wiſdome, in the Divine <hi>Magia</hi> as a figure, or Image without ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet that<note n="ſ" place="margin">Or <hi>being.</hi>
                     </note> thing hath not been ſubſtantiall, but Eſſentiall, and hath been knowne in the Principle, in the flaſh, where the fire ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; But the ſhadow of it hath (from Eternity in a figurative Image,) figured it ſelfe in the Deſiring will of God; and hath ſtood<note n="t" place="margin">Or in the preſence of the Ternary.</note> before the Ternary of God in the <hi>Magia</hi> in the wiſdome of God, as a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the Holy Trinity: in which, God hath manifeſted himſelfe as in a Glaſſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſubſtance and Image of the ſoule, may be reſembled to the Earth, having a faire flower growing out of it, and alſo to the fire and Light: as we ſee that Earth is a<note n="u" place="margin">Ground, foundation, <hi>or</hi> ſoyle, <hi>or</hi> the Mother of that which groweth upon it.</note> Center, but no Life; yet it is Eſſentiall: and a faire flower groweth out of it, which is not like Earth, neither hath it the ſmell and taſte of the Earth, much leſſe the figure of it: and yet the Earth is the Mother of the flower.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And ſo the ſoule alſo<note n="x" place="margin">ſhone.</note> appeared out of the Eternall Center of Nature, out of the Eternall Eſſence, with the word <hi>Fiat</hi> in the will of God; and was held in the <hi>Fiat,</hi> ſo that it<note n="x" place="margin">ſhone.</note> appeared as a fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Eye, and ſimilitude of the firſt Principle in a creaturely forme, and ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And from this Eye went the Glance of its Fire, as Light doth from fire: and in this Glance of its owne Fire, the Eternall Image (which is in the wiſdome of God) was ſeen and conceived by the will of the Heart of God in the ſecond Principle: that is, by the word <hi>Fiat</hi> of the ſecond Principle, in the Love and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Holy Trinity, whence the Holy Ghoſt procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And thus the ſoule was a whole ſimilitude and Image of the Holy Trinity: here we muſt take the ſoule for the Center of Nature, and its fiery Life for the firſt Principle: but the ſprout, or the Image of the ſoule, which is a ſimilitude of God, buddeth forth from the ſoule, as a flower from the Earth, and is compriſed by the Holy Ghoſt; for it is his Manſion.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Now if the ſoule put its Imagination out from it ſelfe, (wee meane out from its<note n="y" place="margin">Or <hi>property.</hi>
                     </note> ſource of fire) into the Light of God, then it receiveth the Light, as the Moone doth the glance of the Sunne:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:171923:86"/> and ſo its Image is in the Majeſty of God, and the ſoule, in the Light of God, and its fiery Property is changed into meekneſſe and fervent Love, and then it is know ne to be the child of God.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But ſeeing the ſoule is Eſſentiall, and its owne ſubſtance a Deſire; it is plaine that it conſiſts in two <hi>Fiats,</hi> one of them is its corporeall propriety, and the other is the ſecond Principle, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from Gods will which is in the ſoule, in which God deſireth to have<note n="z" place="margin">The ſoule.</note> it his Image and ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. To which End Gods deſiring, is as a <hi>Fiat</hi> in the Centre of the ſoule, and continually draweth the will of the ſoule towards the Heart of God: for the Longing of God would have the ſoule:<note n="a" place="margin">Luſt, pleaſure, will, <hi>or</hi> deſire.</note> and on the contrary the Center in the power of the Fire would have it.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. For, the life of the ſoule hath its originall in the Fire, and that makes the ſtriving for the Image of the ſoule: and which of theſe two Formes whether it be the Fire, or meekneſſe of Love that overcommeth, that will be the quality of the ſoule, and as the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the will of the ſoule is: ſuch an Image will the ſoule have.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And we muſt know, that if the will of the ſoule change it ſelfe, then its Forme will be alſo changed: for if the<note n="b" place="margin">Quality, <hi>or</hi> property.</note> ſource of the ſoule be fiery, then it hath alſo a fiery Image.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But if the ſoule turne its Imagination into the Center, into the ſtrong<note n="c" place="margin">Or <hi>harſhnes.</hi>
                     </note> Aſtringency and bitterneſſe, then its faire Image is alſo captivated in the darke aſtrengency; and infected with the Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent wrath.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And then this wrath is a <hi>Turba,</hi> which poſſeſſeth the Image, and deſtroyeth the ſimilitude of God: for in God there is Love, Light, and meekneſſe: but in this Image there is Darkneſſe, aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency and bitterneſſe, and the Eſſentiall<note n="d" place="margin">Quality, <hi>or</hi> property.</note> ſource is fire, proceeding from the Eſſences of wrath; and then this Image belongeth not to the Kingdome of God, ſo long as it continueth in this<note n="e" place="margin">Quality, condition, <hi>or</hi> property.</note> ſource and forme in the Darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Fire is a further ſimilitude of the ſoule: the ſoule is an Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Fire, and the flaſh of the Fire is the Life of it: The ſoule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth a Globe, or an Eye of Fire.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. The burning Fire in the ſource ſignifieth the firſt Principle, and the Life, yet the Fire is not the Life: but the Spirit of the ſource which ariſeth from the Fire, and goeth forth from the firelike Aire, that is the true Spirit of the ſource of the Life of the Fire, which continually bloweth the fire up again, and maketh it burne.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Now the fire ſhineth, and giveth Light out of the ſource, and dwelleth in the ſource where it ſhineth: and the ſource compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth not the Light, and this ſignifieth the ſecond Principle, wherein God dwelleth.</p>
                  <p n="19">
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:171923:87"/>19. For we know that the<note n="f" place="margin">Or <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                     </note> Power is in the Light, and not in the Fire, the fire onely giveth Eſſences to the Light, and the Life, or the Light produceth meekneſſe and ſubſtantiality, <hi>viz.</hi> water.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Now we underſtand, that there is a<note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> amiable, Loving.</note> meeke Life in the Light, without<note n="h" place="margin">Or <hi>paine.</hi>
                     </note> ſource, and yet it ſelfe is an inſenſible<note n="h" place="margin">Or <hi>paine.</hi>
                     </note> ſource, it is nothing but a Longing, or deſire of Love.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Which Source we account a Tincture, in which the budding and bloſſoming hath its Originall, yet the Fire is the cauſe of it, and the meekneſſe is a cauſe of the ſubſtantiality: for the Deſire of Love in the Light attracteth it, and keepeth it, ſo that it becommeth a ſubſtance, but the Deſire of Fire conſumeth the ſubſtantiality.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Alſo we muſt conceive that, (as the ſoule is purely and alone in the Center) it is an Eſſentiall Fire in the Eye of Eternity, and yet that Eye deſireth a figure and Image of the wiſdome of God.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And the Image is in its deſire, in its Imagination, for the<note n="i" place="margin">Verbum fiat.</note> word <hi>Fiat</hi> hath comprehended it, that it might be a ſimilitude of the Eternall wiſdome of God, wherein he dwelleth, and wherein he may manifeſt himſelfe by his Spirit, and what ever hath been in his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Counſell.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Thus the Majeſty of God flameth in the Image, in the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Fire, if the Eſſentiall Fire putteth its deſire into the Majeſty, but if not, then the Image is<note n="k" place="margin">Voyd, <hi>or</hi> empty.</note> raw and naked without God, and the Tincture is falſe.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. For the Image is in the Tincture, and hath its originall in the Tincture, in the Light, not in the ſource of the Fire: and as the Heart or word of God hath its Originall in the Light of the Majeſty, in the Eternall Tincture of the fire of the Father, ſo hath the Image of the ſoule,</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Indeed the Image dwelleth in the fire of the ſoule, as Light dwelleth in the Fire, but it hath another Principle, as the Light is ſuch a ſource as is different from Fire.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. And ſo the true Image of God dwelleth in the Light of the Fire of the ſoule; which Light the fiery ſoule muſt create in the fountaine of the Love of God, in the Majeſty, by putting and yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding its Imagination into it.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. And if the ſoule doe not ſo, but putteth its Imagination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelfe, into its wrathfull forme of the ſource of the fire, and not into the fountaine of Love, into the Light of God, then its owne ſource of<note n="l" place="margin">Sterneſſe, ſharpneſſe, <hi>or</hi> eagerneſſe.</note> fourcneſſe, aſtringency, and bitterneſſe riſeth up: and the Image of God becommeth a <hi>Turba,</hi> and ſwalloweth up the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of God in the wrath.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. And then the Aſtringent <hi>Fiat</hi> in the fiery Eſſence of the ſoule, figureth for the ſoule an Image, of the Imagination that is in its will: whatſoever the Eſſentiall fire of the ſoule deſireth, that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:171923:87"/> will be figured in the ſoule; <hi>viz.</hi> Earthly Figures: that which the will of the Heart caſteth it ſelfe into, that Image the <hi>Fiat</hi> of the ſoule will make: that is, as farre as the third Principle, and the Spirit of the Starres and Elements hath power.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. So that if the will of the ſoule doe caſt it ſelfe into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world, then the outward Kingdome hath power to bring its Imagination into the inward Principle, and if the inward <hi>Fiat</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that in the fire of the ſoule, then it becommeth pregnant with it, and keepeth it.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. And then the ſoule hath the Image of a Beaſt in the third Principle, and that cannot be deſtroyed for ever, except the will of the ſoule returne againe out of the earthly Luſt, and pierce into the Love of God againe, and then it getteth the Image of God againe: which may be done onely in this life, while the ſoule is Eſſentially in its<note n="m" place="margin">Ground, <hi>or</hi> ſoyle, <hi>or</hi> bed of Earth.</note> Ether, in the growing of its Tree: but after this Life it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Thus you may underſtand what the ſoule, Spirit, Image, and <hi>Turba</hi> are the ſoule dwelleth in it ſelfe, and is an Eſſentiall Fire, and its Image ſtandeth in it ſelfe, in the Imagination in the Light of the ſoule, if it cleave to God, if not, then it is in Anxiety in the wrath of darkneſſe, and is an<note n="n" place="margin">Vizard, <hi>or</hi> Monſter.</note> abominable Image, or an Image of the Devill.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. The <hi>Turba</hi> of the ſoule which deſtroyeth the Divine Image, is the Eſſentiall wrathfulneſſe, and it is cauſed by the Imagination, or falſe Love, and<note n="o" place="margin">Or <hi>Imaging.</hi>

                  <p n="34">34. It is very neceſſary for us to ſtrive continually againſt the Earthly Reaſon of fleſh and bloud; and to yield the Spirit of our wills into the mercy and Love of God, and alwayes caſt our ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the will of God, and not count Earthly<note n="p" place="margin">Or <hi>profit.</hi>

                     <hi>2.</hi> For a mans owne Reaſon without the Light of God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come into the Ground [of them,] it is impoſſible; let his wit be never ſo high and ſubtill, it apprehendeth but as it were the ſhadow of it in a Glaſſe.</p>

                     <hi>3.</hi> For, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>without me you can doe nothing:</hi> and he is the Light of the world: and the Life of men.</p>
                  <p n="4">

                     <hi>5.</hi> If he have not a purpoſe, that if God ſhould reveale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his myſteries to him; he would be one Spirit, and have one will with him, and wholly reſigne and yeild himſelfe up to him; that Gods Spirit might doe what he pleaſeth, with him, and by him, and that God might be his knowledge, will, and<note n="d" place="margin">Or working.</note> deed: he is not yet fit for ſuch knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> For, there are many that ſeeke Myſteries and hidden knowledge, meerely that they might be reſpected, and highly eſteemed by the world; and for their owne gaine and profit: but they attaine not this ground, where the Spirit ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God: as it is written.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7.</hi> It muſt be a totally reſigned and yeilded will, in which God himſelfe ſearcheth and worketh, and which continually pierceth into God, in yeilding and reſigned Humility, ſeeking nothing but his Eternall Native Country, and to doe his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſervice with it: and then it may be attained: and he muſt begin with effectuall Repentance and amendment, and with prayer that his underſtanding might be opened from within; for, then the inward will bring it ſelfe into the outward.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> But when he readeth ſuch writings and yet cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, he muſt not preſently throw them away, and thinke it is impoſſible to underſtand them: no, but he muſt turne his minde to God, beſeeching him for Grace and underſtanding, and reade againe, and then he ſhall ſee more and more in them, till at length he be drawne by the Power of God into the very depth it ſelfe, and ſo come into the ſupernaturall and ſuper-ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall ground, <hi>viz.</hi> into the Eternall unity of God; where hee ſhall heare unſpeakable and effectuall words of God which ſhall bring him back and outward againe (by the Divine Effluence) to the very groſſeſt and meaneſt matter of the Earth, and then back and inwards to God againe: then the Spirit of God ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things with him, and by him, and ſo he is rightly taught and driven by God.</p>

                     <hi>THE CLAVIS,</hi> OR <hi>KEY.</hi> OR, <hi>An Expoſition of ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Words, and Matters.</hi> How God is to be conſidered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Nature, and Creature.</head>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OSES</hi> ſaith: the Lord our God is but one onely God. In another place is ſaid; of him, through him, and in him are all things: in another, am not I he that filleth all things? And in another: through his Word are all things made, that are made: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may ſay that he is the Originall of all things. He is the Eternall unmeaſurable unity.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. For example: when I thinke what would be in the place of this world, if the foure Elements and the ſtarry Firmament, and alſo Nature it ſelfe ſhould periſh and ceaſe to be; ſo that no Nature or Creature were to be found any more: I finde there would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine this Eternall Unity from which Nature and Creature have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Originall.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. So likewiſe, when I think with my ſelf what is many hundred thouſand miles above the ſtarry Firmament: Or what is in that place
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:171923:92"/> where no Creature is. I finde the Eternall unchangeable unity is there; which is that onely good, which hath nothing either before or after it, that can adde any thing to it, or take any thing away from it, or from which this unity could have its Originall: There is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground, time, nor place, but there is the onely Eternall God: or that onely Good, which a man cannot expreſſe.</p>

                     <head>A further Conſideration, How this one God is Three-fold.</head>
                     <p n="17">17. The Holy Scripture ſheweth us that this only God is<note n="a" place="margin">Or <hi>Triune.</hi>
                        </note> Thre fold: <hi>viz.</hi> one onely threefold Eſſence, having three manner of workings, and yet is but one onely Eſſence: as may be ſeen in the outflowne Power and vertue which is in all things, if any doe but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it: but it is eſpecially repreſented to us in Fire, Light, and Aire: which are three ſeverall<note n="b" place="margin">ſubſiſtent Formes.</note> ſorts of workings, and yet but in one onely ground and ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. And as we ſee that Fire Light and Aire ariſe from a Candle, (though the Candle be none of the three but a cauſe of them) ſo likewiſe the Eternall unity is the cauſe and ground of the Eternall Trinity, which manifeſteth it ſelfe from the unity, and bringeth forth it ſelfe in firſt Deſire or will,<note place="margin">

                     <p n="20">20. The Pleaſure or Delight is the Sonne; and is, that which the will willeth and deſireth, <hi>viz.</hi> his Love and pleaſure, as may be ſeen, at the Baptiſme of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when the Father witneſſed, ſaying: <hi>This is my</hi>

                     <p n="21">21. The Delight is the<note n="e" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the will.</note> compreſſure in the will, whereby the will in the unity bringeth it ſelfe into a place and working, wherewith the; will willeth and worketh: and it is the<note n="f" place="margin">Or <hi>percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                        </note> feelingneſſe and vertue of the will.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. The will is the Father; that is, the ſtirring deſire: and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is the Sonne, that is, the vertue and the working in the will, with which the will worketh: and the Holy Ghoſt is the proceeding will through the Delight of the vertue; that is, a Life of the will, and of the vertue and delight.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. Thus there are three ſorts of workings in the Eternall Unity, <hi>viz.</hi> the unity is the will and deſire of it ſelfe; the Delight is the working ſubſtance of the will, and an Eternall joy of feelingneſſe in the will; and the Holy Ghoſt is the proceeding of the Power: the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of which may be ſeen in a<note n="g" place="margin">Or <hi>hearb.</hi>

                     <p n="25">25. In this working feelingneſſe, the Magneticall deſiring will is elevated and made joyfull, and goeth forth from the working Power and vertue, and hence commeth the growing and ſmell of the<note n="i" place="margin">Or <hi>formeth.</hi>
                        </note> Plant: and thus we ſee a repreſentation of the Trinity of God in all<note n="k" place="margin">Vegetables, and animate things.</note> growing and living things.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. If there were not ſuch a deſiring feelingneſſe, and outgoing, working of the Trinity in the Eternall unity, the unity were but an Eternall ſtilneſſe; a Nothing; and there would be no Nature, nor any Colour ſhape or figure: likewiſe there would be nothing in this world, without this threefold working, no, there could be no world at all.</p>

                     <head>Of the Eternall word of God.</head>
                     <p n="27">27. The Holy Scripture ſaith: God hath made all things by his Eternall word; alſo it ſaith: That word is God, <hi>John</hi> 1. which wee underſtand thus.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. The word is nothing elſe but the<note n="l" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> out-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> out-breathing will, from the Power and vertue: a various dividing of the Power into a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Powers; a diſtributing and outflowing of the unity, whence knowledge ariſeth.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. For in one onely Subſtance, wherein there is no variation, or Diviſion; but is onely one, there can be no knowledge; and if there were knowledge, it could know but one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> it ſelfe: but if it part it ſelfe, then the dividing will goeth into multitude and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and each parting worketh in it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. Yet becauſe Unity cannot be divided and parted aſunder, therefore the ſeparating conſiſteth and remaineth in the out-breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will in the unity; and the ſeparation of the breathing giveth the different variety: whereby the Eternall<note n="m" place="margin">Father.</note> will, together with the<note n="n" place="margin">Sonne.</note> Delight and<note n="o" place="margin">Holy Ghoſt.</note> proceeding, entreth into the<note n="p" place="margin">Or <hi>Science.</hi>

                     <p n="73">73. For, that which the Deſire compreſſeth and maketh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the motion cutteth aſunder and divideth, ſo that it commeth into formes and Images: between theſe two Properties ariſeth the bitter<note n="d" place="margin">Or <hi>paine.</hi>

                        </note> feelable, but in the moveable ſharpneſſe it becommeth feeling.</p>
                     <p n="78">78. And this feelingneſſe is the cauſe of the Fire, and alſo of the mind and Senſes: for the owne Naturall will is made volatile by it,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:171923:96"/> and ſeeketh Reſt: and thus the ſeparation of the will goeth out from it ſelfe; and pierceth through the Properties, from whence the taſte ariſeth, ſo that one Propertie taſteth and feeleth the other.</p>
                     <p n="79">79. It is alſo the ground and cauſe of the Senſes, in that one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty penetrateth into the other, and kindleth the other, ſo that the will knoweth whence the paſſiveneſſe commeth: for, if feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe were not, the will could know nothing of the Properties, for it were meerely alone: and thus the Will receiveth Nature into it by feeling the ſharp motion in it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="80">80. This motion is in it ſelf like a turning wheele; not that there is ſuch a turning and winding; but it is ſo in the Properties; for, the Deſire attracteth into it ſelfe, and the Motion thruſteth forwards out of it ſelfe; and ſo the will being in this anguiſh, can neither get inwards nor outwards, and yet is drawen both out of it ſelfe, and into it ſelfe; and ſo it remaineth in ſuch a<note n="l" place="margin">forme, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>or</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Poſture, as will into it ſelfe and out of it ſelfe, (that is, over it ſelfe and under it ſelfe;) and yet can goe no whither, but is an Anguiſh: and the true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Hell, and of Gods Anger; for this Anguiſh ſtandeth in the darke ſharp Motion.</p>

                     </p>

                     <p n="84">84.

Thus, by the third Property of Nature which is the Anguiſh, we meane the ſharpneſſe and painefulneſſe of the fire, <hi>viz.</hi> the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and conſuming: for when the will is put into ſuch a ſharpneſſe, it will alwayes conſume the cauſe of that ſharpneſſe; for it alwayes<note n="t" place="margin">

                     <p n="86">86.

                     <head>☉ The fourth Property</head>
                     <p n="87">87. The fourth Property of the Eternall Nature is the Spirituall Fire, wherein the Light; that is, the unity, is made manifeſt: for the<note n="x" place="margin">Shining, <hi>or</hi> Luſter <hi>or</hi> brightneſſe.</note> Glance of the fire, ariſeth and proceedeth from the outflowne unity, which hath incorporated and united it ſelfe with the Naturall Deſire: and the burning property of fire, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heat procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the ſharp devouringneſſe of the firſt three Properties, which commeth to be ſo as followeth.</p>
                     <p n="88">88. The Eternall unity (which I alſo in ſome of my writings, call the Liberty) is the ſoft and ſtill tranquility, being amiable, and as a ſoft comfortable eaſe, and it cannot be expreſſed how ſoft a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility there is without Nature in the unity of God: But the three Properties (in order) to Nature are ſharp, painefull, and horrible.</p>
                     <p n="89">89. In theſe three painefull Properties the outflowne will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, and is produced by the word or Divine Breathing; and the unity alſo is therein, therefore the Will longeth Earneſtly for the unity, and the unity longeth for the feelingneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> for the fiery ground: thus the one longeth to get into the other; and when this Longing is, there is as it were a<note n="y" place="margin">Scraſhing.</note> cracking noyſe or flaſh of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as when we rub ſteele and a ſtone together, or power water into fire; this we ſpeake by way of ſimilitude.</p>
                     <p n="90">90. In that Flaſh the unity feeleth the feelingneſſe, and the will receiveth the ſoft tranquill unity: and ſo the unity becomes a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Glance of Fire, and the fire becommeth a burning Love; for it receiveth<note n="z" place="margin">Or <hi>Entity.</hi>
                        </note> the <hi>Ens,</hi> and power from the ſoft unity: in this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the darkneſſe of the Magneticall compreſſure is pierced
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:171923:97"/> through with the Light, ſo that it is no more knowne or diſcerned, although it remaineth in it ſelfe Eternally in the compreſſure.</p>
                     <p n="91">91. Now two Eternall Princlples ariſe here, <hi>viz.</hi> the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, harſhneſſe, ſharpneſſe, and paine dwelling in it ſelfe: and the feeling power and vertue of the unity in the Light: upon which the Scripture ſaith, that God, (that is, the Eternall unity) dwelleth in a Light to which none can<note n="a" place="margin">Or <hi>approach.</hi>
                        </note> come.</p>
                     <p n="92">92. For ſo the Eternall uity of God manifeſteth it ſelfe through the Spirituall Fire, in the Light: and this Light is called Majeſty; and God, (that is the Supernaturall unity) is the Power and vertue of it.</p>
                     <p n="93">93. For the Spirit of this Fire receiveth <hi>Ens</hi> [or vertue] to ſhine, from the unity, or elſe this fiery<note n="b" place="margin">Or <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                        </note> ground would be but a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, horrible hunger, and pricking deſire: and it is ſo indeed, when the will breaketh it ſelfe off from the unity, and will live, after its owne deſire, as the Devils have done, and the falſe ſoule ſtill doth.</p>
                     <p n="94">94. And thus you may here perceive two Principles, the firſt, is the ground of the burning of the Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſharp moving per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable painfull darkneſſe in it ſelfe: and the ſecond is the Light of the Fire, wherein the unity commeth into mobility and Joy: for, the Fire is an object of the great Love of Gods unity.</p>
                     <p n="95">95. For, ſo the Eternall Delight becommeth perceiveable, and this perceiving of the unity is called Love, and is a Burning or Life, in the unity of God: and according to this burning of Love, God calleth himſelfe a mercifull loving God: for the unity of God loveth and pierceth through the<note n="c" place="margin">Akeing.</note> painfull will of the Fire: (which at the beginning, aroſe in the breathing of the word, or outgoing of the Divine Delight) and changeth it into great Joy.</p>
                     <p n="96">96. And in this fiery will of the Eternall Nature ſtandeth the ſoule of Man, and alſo the Angels: this is their ground and Center: therefore, if any ſoule breake it ſelfe off from the Light and Love of God, and entreth into its owne Naturall Deſire; then the ground of this darkneſſe and painfull<note n="d" place="margin">Or <hi>ſource.</hi>
                        </note> property will be manifeſt in it: and this is the helliſh Fire, and the Anger of God, when it is made manifeſt, as may be ſeene in <hi>Lucifer:</hi> and whatſoever can be thought to have a Being<note n="e" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or</hi> every where.</note> any where in the Creature, the ſame is likewiſe without the Creature every where: for, the Creature is nothing elſe but an Image and Figure of the ſeparable and various power, and vertue of the univerſall Being.</p>
                     <p n="97">97 Now underſtand aright what the ground of Fire is, <hi>viz.</hi> Cold, from the Compreſſure and heate from the Anguiſh, and the Motion is the<note n="f" place="margin">

The firſt is the going upwards of the fiery will, the ſecond is the going downewards, or ſinking, of rhe watery Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> the Meekneſſe; and the third is the going out forwards, of the oyly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the midſt, in the Center of the fiery Spirit of the will; which oyly Spirit, is the Ens of the unity of God; which is become a ſubſtance in the deſire of Nature: yet all is but Spirit and Power; but ſo it appeares in the figure of the Manifeſtation, not as if there were any ſevering or diviſion, but it appeares ſo in the Manifeſtation.</p>
                     <p n="110">110. This threefold manifeſtation is according to the Trinity; for the Centre wherein it is, is the onely God according to his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation: the fiery flaming Spirit of Love is that which goeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and the meekneſſe which proceedeth from the Love is that which goeth downwards, and in the midſt there is the Center [<note n="l" place="margin">Or</note> of] the circumference, which is the Father, or whole God according to his manifeſtation.</p>
                     <p n="111">111. And as this is to be knowne in the Divine manifeſtation, ſo it is alſo in the Eternall Nature, according to Natures property: for Nature is but a<note n="m" place="margin">Picture, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, <hi>or</hi> ſhadow.</note> Reſemblance of the Deity.</p>
                     <p n="112">112. Nature may be further conſidered thus; the flaſh of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of fire, is a crack, and ſalnitrous ground, whence Nature goeth forth into infinite diviſions, that is, into multitudes or varieties of Powers and vertues; from which the multitude of Angels and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and their colours and operations proceeded, alſo the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the Beginning of time.</p>
                     <p n="113">113. For, the<note n="n" place="margin">Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>or</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> temperature of fire and Light is the holy Element, <hi>viz.</hi> the motion in the Light of the unity; and from this ſalnitrous ground (we meane ſpirituall not earthly ſalnitre) the foure Elements proceed, <hi>viz.</hi> in the<note n="o" place="margin">Compreſſure, <hi>or</hi> impreſſure, in every place where that word is uſed following.</note> compreſſure of the fiery <hi>Mercury,</hi> Earth and ſtones are produced; and in the Quinteſſence of the fiery <hi>Mercury,</hi> the fire and Heaven; and in the Motion or going forth, the Aire; and in the diſruption or rending of the Deſire by the fire, the water is produced.</p>
                     <p n="114">114. The fiery <hi>Mercurie</hi> is a drie water, that hath brought forth Mettals and ſtones; but the broken or divided <hi>Mercury</hi> hath brought

                     <p n="127">127. For, according to the manifeſtation of the Trinity of God there are but three Properties of Nature: the firſt is the Deſire which belongeth to God the Father, yet it is onely a Spirit, but in the ſeventh Property the Deſire is ſubſtantiall.</p>
                     <p n="128">128. The ſecond is the Divine power and vertue, and belongeth to God the Sonne; in the ſecond Number it is onely a Spirit, but in the ſixt it is the ſubſtantiall Power and vertue.</p>

                     <p n="178">178. Therefore Man, who is ſo noble an Image, having his ground in time and Eternity; ſhould well conſider himſelfe, and not run headlong in ſuch blindneſſe, ſeeking his Native Country afarre off from himſelfe, when it is within himſelfe, though covered with the groſſeneſſe of the Elements by their ſtrife.</p>
                     <p n="179">179. Now when the ſtrife of the Elements ceaſeth, by the Death of the groſſe body, then the Spirituall Man will be made manifeſt whether he be borne in and to Light or Darkneſſe; which of theſe [two] beareth the ſway and hath the dominion in him, the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all man hath his being in it Eternally, whether it be in the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Anger, or in his Love.</p>
                     <p n="180">180. For, the outward viſible Man is not now the Image of God, it is nothing but an Image of the <hi>Archaeus;</hi> that is, a houſe [or huske] of the Spirituall Man, in which the ſpirituall Man groweth; as Gold doth in the<note n="f" place="margin">

                     <p n="181">181. The outward groſſe Body of the foure Elements ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God, but that which is borne out of that one Element, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the Divine Manifeſtation and working.</p>
                     <p n="182">182. For, this of the Fleſh and of the will of man is not it: but that which is wrought by the heavenly <hi>Archaeus</hi> in this groſſe Body, unto which this groſſe [body] is a houſe Toole and Inſtrument.</p>
                     <p n="183">183. But when the Cruſt is taken away, then it ſhall appeare wherefore we have here been called Men; and yet ſome of us have ſcarce been beaſts, nay ſome far worſe then Beaſts.</p>
                     <p n="184">184. For, we ſhould rightly conſider what the Spirit of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward world is, it is a houſe huske, and Inſtrument of the Inward Spirituall world which is hidden therein, and worketh through it, and ſo bringeth it ſelfe into figures and Images.</p>

                     <p n="188">188. God is the Eternall, Immenſe Incomprehenſible unity which manifeſteth it ſelfe in it selfe from Eternity in Eternity by the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and is Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt, in a threefold working, as is before mentioned.</p>
                     <p n="189">189. The firſt Effluence and manifeſtation of this Trinity is the Eternall word, or outſpeaking of the Divine power and vertue.</p>
                     <p n="190">190. The firſt outſpoken Subſtance from that Power is the Divine wiſdome; which is a ſubſtance wherein the Power worketh.</p>
                     <p n="191">191. Out of the wiſdome floweth the Power and vertue of out-breathing, and goeth into ſeparability and forming; and therein the Divine Power is manifeſt in its vertue.</p>
                     <p n="102">102. Theſe ſeparable Powers and vertues bring themſelves into receivingneſſe, to their owne perceivingneſſe; and out of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivingneſſe ariſeth owne ſelfe-will and Deſire: this owne Will is the Ground of the Eternall Nature, and it bringeth it ſelfe, with the Deſire into the Properties as farre as Fire.</p>
                     <p n="193">193. In the Deſire is the Originall of Darkneſſe: and in the Fire the Eternall unity is made manifeſt with the Light, in the fiery Nature.</p>
                     <p n="194">194. Out of this fiery Property and the property of the Light, the Angels and ſoules have their Originall; which is a Divine Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation.</p>
                     <p n="195">195. The Power and vertue of Fire and Light is called Tincture; and the Motion of this vertue is called the holy and Pure Element.</p>
                     <p n="196">196. The Darkneſſe becommeth ſubſtantiall in it ſelfe: and the Light becommeth alſo ſubſtantiall in the fiery Deſire: theſe two make two Principles: <hi>viz.</hi> Gods Anger in the Darkneſſe, and Gods Love in the Light, each of them worketh in it ſelfe, and there is onely ſuch a difference between them as between Day and Night, and yet both of them have but one onely Ground, and the one is alwayes a cauſe of the other, and that the other becommeth manifeſt and knowne in it, as Light from fire.</p>
                     <p n="197">197. The viſible world is the third Principle, that is, the third
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:171923:105"/> Ground and beginning; this is outbreathed out of the Inward Ground, (<hi>viz.</hi> out of both the firſt Principles) and brought into the Nature and forme of a Creature.</p>
                     <p n="198">198. The Inward Eternall working is hidden in the viſible world, and it is in every thing and through every thing, yet not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehened by any thing in the things owne Power; the outward Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and vertues are but the paſſive and the houſe, in which the Inward doe worke.</p>
                     <p n="199">199.<note n="l" place="margin">The common Creatures.</note> All the other worldly Creatures are but the Subſtance of the outward world; but Man; who is created both out of Time and Eternity, out of the Being of all Beings, and made an Image of the Divine Manifeſtation.</p>
                     <p n="200">200. The Eternall Manifeſtation of the Divine Light is called the Kingdome of Heaven, and the Habitation of the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Soules.</p>
                     <p n="201">201. The fiery Darkneſſe is called Hell, or Gods Anger, wherein the Devills dwell, together with the damned ſoules.</p>
                     <p n="202">202. In the place of this world Heaven and Hell are preſent every where; but according to the Inward Ground.</p>
                     <p n="203">203. Inwardly, the Divine working is manifeſt in Gods Children; But in the wicked, the working of the painefull darkneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="204">204. The place of the Eternall Paradiſe is hidden in this world, in the Inward Ground: but manifeſt in the Inward man, in which Gods Power and vertue worketh.</p>
                     <p n="205">205. There ſhall periſh of this world onely the foure Elements together with the Starry Heaven; and the Earthly Creatures; <hi>viz.</hi> the outward groſſe Life of all things.</p>

                     <p n="208">208.

                  <p n="211">211. You underſtand by Science ſome skill or knowledge: in which you ſay true, but doe not fully expreſſe the meaning.</p>
                  <p n="212">212. Science is the Root to the underſtanding, as to the<note n="o" place="margin">Cogitation, conſideration, <hi>or</hi> Reaſoning.</note> Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: it is the Root to the Center of the<note n="p" place="margin">Or <hi>forming.</hi>

                  <p n="213">213. The will is in the Separability of the Science, and there ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth it ſelfe out from the Impreſſed Compaction; and men firſt of all underſtand the Eſſence in that which is ſeparated, in which the Separability impreſſeth it ſelfe into a Subſtance.</p>
                  <p n="214">214. For<note n="q" place="margin">ESSENTZ.</note> Eſſence is a ſubſtantiall power and vertue, but Science is a moving flitting one, like the Senſes; it is indeed the Root of the Senſes.</p>
                  <p n="215">215. Yet in the underſtanding, in which it is called Science, it is not the ſenſing, but a cauſe of the ſenſing, in that manner as when the Underſtanding impreſſeth it ſelfe in the Mind, there muſt firſt be

                  <p n="216">216. I could not give it any other better Name, this doth ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accord and agree in the ſenſe: for the Science is the cauſe that the Divine Abyſſall Will compacteth and impreſſeth it ſelfe into Nature, to the ſeparable [various] intelligible and perceivable Life of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and difference: for the Impreſſure of the Science, (whereby the will attracteth it into it ſelfe) the Naturall Life ariſeth and the word of every Life Originally.</p>
